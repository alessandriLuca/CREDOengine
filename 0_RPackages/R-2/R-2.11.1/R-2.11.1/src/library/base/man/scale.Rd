\title{Scaling and Centering of Matrix-like Objects}
\description{
  \code{scale} is generic function whose default method centers and/or
  scales the columns of a numeric matrix.
}
\usage{
scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric matrix(like object).}
  \item{center}{either a logical value or a numeric vector of length
    equal to the number of columns of \code{x}.}
  \item{scale}{either a logical value or a numeric vector of length
    equal to the number of columns of \code{x}.}
}
\value{
  For \code{scale.default}, the centered, scaled matrix. The numeric
  centering and scalings used (if any) are returned as attributes
  \code{"scaled:center"} and \code{"scaled:scale"}
}
\details{
  The value of \code{center} determines how column centering is
  performed.  If \code{center} is a numeric vector with length equal to
  the number of columns of \code{x}, then each column of \code{x} has
  the corresponding value from \code{center} subtracted from it.  If
  \code{center} is \code{TRUE} then centering is done by subtracting the
  column means (omitting \code{NA}s) of \code{x} from their
  corresponding columns, and if \code{center} is \code{FALSE}, no
  centering is done.

  The value of \code{scale} determines how column scaling is performed
  (after centering).  If \code{scale} is a numeric vector with length
  equal to the number of columns of \code{x}, then each column of
  \code{x} is divided by the corresponding value from \code{scale}.  If
  \code{scale} is \code{TRUE} then scaling is done by dividing the
  (centered) columns of \code{x} by their standard deviations, and if
  \code{scale} is \code{FALSE}, no scaling is done.

  The standard deviation for a column is obtained by computing the
  square-root of the sum-of-squares of the non-missing values in the
  column divided by the number of non-missing values minus one (whether
  or not centering was done).
