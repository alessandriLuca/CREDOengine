\title{Array Transposition}
\description{
  Transpose an array by permuting its dimensions and optionally resizing
  it.
}
\usage{
aperm(a, perm, resize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{a}{the array to be transposed.}
  \item{perm}{the subscript permutation vector, which must be a
    permutation of the integers \code{1:n}, where \code{n} is the
    number of dimensions of \code{a}.  The default is to reverse the
    order of the dimensions.}
  \item{resize}{a flag indicating whether the vector should be
    resized as well as having its elements reordered (default \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
  A transposed version of array \code{a}, with subscripts permuted as
  indicated by the array \code{perm}.  If \code{resize} is \code{TRUE},
  the array is reshaped as well as having its elements permuted, the
  \code{dimnames} are also permuted; if \code{resize = FALSE} then the
  returned object has the same dimensions as \code{a}, and the dimnames
  are dropped.  In each case other attributes are copied from \code{a}.

  The function \code{t} provides a faster and more convenient way of
  transposing matrices.

# interchange the first two subscripts on a 3-way array x
x  <- array(1:24, 2:4)
xt <- aperm(x, c(2,1,3))
