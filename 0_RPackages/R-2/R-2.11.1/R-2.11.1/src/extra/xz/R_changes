This is subdirectory src/liblzma of xz-utils-4.999.9beta, except for files
Makefile.in, Makefile.win and R_changes

common/{bswap,integer,mythread}.h are from xz-utils-4.999.9beta.

check/{sha256.c,crc_macros.h} is modified to look on the usual include path.

common/local.h is a set of definitions of features to be built, and
common/sysdef.h is a modified copy of
xz-utils-4.999.9beta/common/sysdefs.h which includes it.

All the files from xz-utils are in the public domain.

The subblock encoder is not used: it is not configured in by
default and seems not to work on x86_64 platforms.

Performance optimizations are only used on (32-bit) Windows: 
it is assumed that on other OSes an optimized system liblzma is or 
could be made available.

common/vli_encoder.c,
common/vli_decoder.c,
api/lzma/api.h:
  Remove incorrect use of restrict keyword. See commit
  49cfc8d392cf535f8dd10233225b1fc726fec9ef in the XZ-Utils git
  repository. This is a temporary fix until the next version of
  XZ-Utils is released and integrated. Without this small change
  Intels C compiler and gcc 4.4.x (and possibly others) may generate
  broken code.

common/sysdefs.h:
  Change _Bool to _Bool8 to avoid clashes on one Solaris 10 system.
  (Solaris 10 has stdbool.h, but it was not being found.)
