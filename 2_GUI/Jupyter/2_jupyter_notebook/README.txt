Run runMe.sh providing three parameters : 
- the merged dockerfile folder name
- the newName for the dockerfile for jupyter
- the dockername 
Once the script is finished the new dockerfile folder will appear. Just enter in the folder and run the script.sh. This script will automatically build the Dockerfile
and run the container. While the docker is running open your favourite browser and go to localhost:8888.
Have fun with jupyter! A shared folder is created automatically in your home folder so you can save all the script and data there.
