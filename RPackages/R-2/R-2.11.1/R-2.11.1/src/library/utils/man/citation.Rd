\description{
  How to cite \R and \R packages in publications.
}
\usage{
citation(package = "base", lib.loc = NULL)
\S3method{toBibtex}{citation}(object, \dots)
\S3method{toBibtex}{citationList}(object, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{package}{a character string with the name of a single package.
    An error occurs if more than one package name is given.}
  \item{lib.loc}{a character vector with path names of \R libraries, or
    \code{NULL}.  The default value of \code{NULL} corresponds to all
    libraries currently known.  If the default is used, the loaded
    packages are searched before the libraries.}
  \item{object}{return object of \code{citation}.}
  \item{\dots}{currently not used.}
}
\details{
  The \R core development team and the very active community of package
  authors have invested a lot of time and effort in creating \R as it is
  today. Please give credit where credit is due and cite \R and \R
  packages when you use them for data analysis.
  
  Execute function \code{citation()} for information on how to cite the
  base R system in publications. If the name of a non-base package is
  given, the function either returns the information contained in the
  \code{\link{CITATION}} file of the package or auto-generates citation
  information. In the latter case the package \file{DESCRIPTION} file is
  parsed, the resulting citation object may be arbitrarily bad, but is
  quite useful (at least as a starting point) in most cases.

  If only one reference is given, the print method shows both a text
  version and a BibTeX entry for it, if a package has more than one
  reference then only the text versions are shown. The BibTeX versions
  can be obtained using function \code{toBibtex} (see the examples below).
}
\value{
  An object of class \code{"citationList"}: see \code{\link{readCitationFile}}.

\examples{
## the basic R reference
citation()

## references for a package -- might not have these installed
if(nchar(system.file(package="lattice"))) citation("lattice")
if(nchar(system.file(package="foreign"))) citation("foreign")

## extract the bibtex entry from the return value
x <- citation()
toBibtex(x)
}
