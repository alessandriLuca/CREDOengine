The Fortran routines here are extracted from LAPACK 3.1.0, then 3.1.1
(http://www.netlib.org/lapack and mirrors).

dlapack?.f are support routines for `real' LAPACK calls
cmplx.f are support routines for LAPACK calls from complex arithmetic
routines, that are only used if COMPLEX*16 is supported by the Fortran
compiler and compatible with the Rcomplex type (guaranteed for f2c users).
Neither will not be compiled if an external LAPACK is used.

For 'base' R addition of a new .Call()able Lapack routine,
all these files must be updated {path relative to R's topdir}:

  src/include/R_ext/Lapack.h
