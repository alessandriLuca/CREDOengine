Testing R build under Windows
=============================

- Build R, the bitmap library, the distribution, the installer.

    make
    make bitmapdll
    make tcl

    make check

    make distribution
    (cd installer; make; make clean)

- Test the rw1060.exe and miniR.exe installers and un-installing.

- cd to ../../tests and run

    make test-all-extras

    Go online and run

    make test-Internet

- Using the installed copy, do some interactive testing

    o Check it will start and run correctly in sdi and mdi modes.
      Check the pager by using help().
      Check also HTML and CHTML help.

    o run demo(graphics) and check the output looks correct.

    o run the tcl/tk demos by

        library(tcltk)
	demo(tkttest)
	demo(tkdensity)
	demo(tkcanvas)
	demo(tkfaq)
	demo(tkfilefind)

    o Check each of the console menu items in turn.  Try the
      right-click popup menu too.

    o Put up a simple plot and experiment with saving, copying and
      printing it.  Also try all the options of savePlot().  You'll
      need to look at the saved files, and paste into e.g. Word.

    o Try using identify().

    o Try the various resize options on the graphics window's menu.

    o Try printing and saving from a graphics window's menu.

    o Experiment with printing from the console, from a pager and
      printing to a win.print() device.

    o Shut down a graphics window, a pager and the console from the
      frame icons and menu, the File menu etc.

    o Test drag-and-drop onto a shortcut on the desktop and into the
      RGui console window.

    o Test the plot history commands on the History menu of a graphics
      window.

    o Try a canvas colour and plot some transparent and opaque
      rectangles.  Try example(points) and example(rect) too.

    o Test help.start() and the HTML help's search engine.  Also check
      cross-links between help files in different packages under HTML
      and CHTML.

    o Try R CMD INSTALL on windlgs.


- Test Rprof and R CMD Rprof.

- Check win.version() is reporting sensibly.

- Run undoc() and codoc() on a package you installed.

- cd front-ends then

    make -f make.rtest
    set R_HOME appropriately
    Rtest.exe
    >  try some simple R commands
    > q()

    If you have access to Visual C++, test it as described in readme.

- Install Thomas Baier's StatConnector (on CRAN under
  Software->Other->Non-standard packages) and run its tests.  (You
  will need to do this on an installed version or run .../bin/RSetReg.exe.)

- Using the installed copy, try building a copy of packages and a
  bundle (e.g. VR) using R CMD INSTALL, and try R CMD check and R CMD
  build too.  Also a package that uses BLAS (e.g. quadprog).

- If you have latex installed, customize .../bin/helpPRINT.bat and
  test help(offline=TRUE).

- Try building using an ATLAS BLAS, and run the make check and make
  test-all-extras tests again.

- Check you can interrupt RGui with ESC and Rterm with Ctrl-C.

- check building Rmath.dll in src/nmath/standalone.
