<h2 class="unnumbered">R Installation and Administration</h2>

<p>This is a guide to installation and administration for R.

   <p>The current version of this document is 2.12.2 (2011-02-25).

   <p>ISBN 3-900051-09-7

<p><a name="Obtaining-R"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">1 Obtaining R</h2>

<p><a name="index-Obtaining-R-1"></a>
Sources, binaries and documentation for R can be obtained via
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>, the &ldquo;Comprehensive R Archive Network&rdquo; whose current
members are listed at <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html">http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html</a>.

<p><a name="Getting-and-unpacking-the-sources"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.1 Getting and unpacking the sources</h3>

<p><a name="index-Sources-for-R-2"></a>
The simplest way is to download the most recent
<samp><span class="file">R-</span><var>x</var><span class="file">.</span><var>y</var><span class="file">.</span><var>z</var><span class="file">.tar.gz</span></samp> file, and unpack it with

<pre class="example">     tar -xf R-<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.<var>z</var>.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">on systems that have a suitable<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a> <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp>
installed.  On other systems you need to have the <samp><span class="command">gzip</span></samp> program
installed, when you can use

<pre class="example">     gzip -dc R-<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.<var>z</var>.tar.gz | tar -xf -
</pre>
   <p>The pathname of the directory into which the sources are unpacked should
not contain spaces, as <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> (specifically <acronym>GNU</acronym>
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> 3.81) does not expect spaces.

   <p>If you want the build to be usable by a group of users, set <code>umask</code>
before unpacking so that the files will be readable by the target group
(e.g., <code>umask 022</code> to be usable by all users).  (Keep this
setting of <code>umask</code> whilst building and installing.)

   <p>If you use the GNU version of <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> and do this as a root
account (which on Windows includes accounts with administrator
privileges) you may seem many warnings about changing ownership.  In
which case you can use

<pre class="example">     tar --no-same-owner -xf R-<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.<var>z</var>.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and perhaps also include the option <samp><span class="option">--no-same-permissions</span></samp>. 
<a name="index-TAR_005fOPTIONS-3"></a>(These options can also be set in the <samp><span class="env">TAR_OPTIONS</span></samp> environment
variable: if more than one option is included they should be separated
by spaces.)

<p><a name="Getting-patched-and-development-versions"></a>

<h3 class="section">1.2 Getting patched and development versions</h3>

<p>A patched version of the current release, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r-patched</span></samp>&rsquo;, and the
current development version, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r-devel</span></samp>&rsquo;, are available as daily
tarballs and via access to the R Subversion repository.  (For the two
weeks prior to the release of a minor (2.x.0) version, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r-patched</span></samp>&rsquo;
will refer to beta/release candidates of the upcoming release, the
patched version of the current release being available only via
Subversion.)

   <p>The tarballs are available from
<a href="ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/pub/Software/R/">ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/pub/Software/R/</a>.  Download either
<samp><span class="file">R-patched.tar.gz</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">R-devel.tar.gz</span></samp> (or the <samp><span class="file">.tar.bz2</span></samp>
versions) and unpack as described in the previous section.  They are
built in exactly the same way as distributions of R releases.

<p><a name="Using-Subversion-and-rsync"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 Using Subversion and rsync</h4>

<p><a name="index-Subversion-4"></a>
Sources are also available via <a href="https://svn.R-project.org/R/">https://svn.R-project.org/R/</a>, the
R Subversion repository.  If you have a Subversion client (see
<a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">http://subversion.apache.org/</a>), you can check out and update the
current &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r-devel</span></samp>&rsquo; from
<a href="https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/">https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/</a> and the current
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r-patched</span></samp>&rsquo; from
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">-branch/</span></samp>&rsquo;
(where <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are the major and minor number of the current
released version of R).  E.g., use

<pre class="example">     svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ <var>path</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to check out &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r-devel</span></samp>&rsquo; into directory <var>path</var>.  The alpha, beta
and RC versions of an upcoming <var>x.y.0</var> release are available from
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-</span><var>x</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">-branch/</span></samp>&rsquo; in
the four-week period prior to the release.

   <p>Note that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">https:</span></samp>&rsquo; is required, and that the SSL certificate for
the Subversion server of the R project should be recognized as from a
trusted source.

   <p>Note that retrieving the sources by e.g. <samp><span class="command">wget -r</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="command">svn export</span></samp> from that URL will not work: the Subversion
information is needed to build R.

   <p>The Subversion repository does not contain the current sources for the
recommended packages, which can be obtained by <samp><span class="command">rsync</span></samp> or
downloaded from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  To use <code>rsync</code> to install the
appropriate sources for the recommended packages, run
<code>./tools/rsync-recommended</code> from the top-level of the R sources.

   <p>If downloading manually from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>, do ensure that you have the
correct versions of the recommended packages: if the number in the file
<samp><span class="file">VERSION</span></samp> is &lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>z</var></samp>&rsquo; you need to download
the contents of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/</span><var>dir</var></samp>&rsquo;,
where <var>dir</var> is &lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>y</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>z</var><span class="samp">/Recommended</span></samp>&rsquo; for
r-devel or <samp><var>x</var><span class="file">.</span><var>y</var><span class="file">-patched/Recommended</span></samp> for r-patched,
respectively, to directory <samp><span class="file">src/library/Recommended</span></samp> in the sources
you have unpacked.  After downloading manually you need to execute
<samp><span class="command">tools/link-recommended</span></samp> from the top level of the sources to
make the requisite links in <samp><span class="file">src/library/Recommended</span></samp>.  A suitable
incantation from the top level of the R sources using <samp><span class="command">wget</span></samp>
might be

<pre class="example">     wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A\*.gz -nd -P src/library/Recommended \
       http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/<var>dir</var>
     ./tools/link-recommended

   <p><a name="index-Linux-6"></a><a name="index-Mac-OS-X-7"></a>In addition, binary distributions are available for some common Linux
distributions and for Mac OS X.  See the <acronym>FAQ</acronym> for current
details.  These are installed in platform-specific ways, so for the rest
of this chapter we consider only building from the sources.

<p><a name="Simple-compilation"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Simple compilation</h3>

<p>First review the essential and useful tools and libraries in
<a href="#Essential-and-useful-other-programs-under-a-Unix_002dalike">Essential and useful other programs under a Unix-alike</a>, and install
those you
<a name="index-TMPDIR-8"></a>want or need.  Ensure that the environment variable <samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp> is
either unset (and <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> exists and can be written in and scripts
can be executed from) or points to a valid temporary directory (one from
which execution of scripts is allowed).

   <p><a name="index-R_005fHOME-9"></a>Choose a place to install the R tree (R is not just a binary, but
has additional data sets, help files, font metrics etc).  Let us call
this place <var>R_HOME</var>.  Untar the source code.  This should create
directories <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp>, and several more under a top-level
directory: change to that top-level directory (At this point North
American readers should consult <a href="#Setting-paper-size">Setting paper size</a>.)  Issue the
following commands:

   <p><a name="index-configure-10"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(See <a href="#Using-make">Using make</a> if your make is not called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>Then check the built system works correctly by

<pre class="example">     make check
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Failures are not necessarily problems as they might be caused by missing
functionality,<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-2" name="fnd-2"><sup>2</sup></a> but you should look carefully at any
reported discrepancies.  (Some non-fatal errors are expected in locales
that do not support Latin-1, in particular in true <code>C</code> locales and
non-UTF-8 non-Western-European locales.)  A failure in
<samp><span class="file">tests/ok-errors.R</span></samp> may indicate inadequate resource limits
(see <a href="#Running-R">Running R</a>).

   <p>More comprehensive testing can be done by

<pre class="example">     make check-devel
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     make check-all
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">see file <samp><span class="file">tests/README</span></samp>.

   <p>If the command <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> commands execute
successfully, a shell-script front-end called <samp><span class="file">R</span></samp> will be created
and copied to <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin</span></samp>.  You can copy this script to a
place where users can invoke it, for example to <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/R</span></samp>. 
You could also copy the man page <samp><span class="file">R.1</span></samp> to a place where your
<samp><span class="command">man</span></samp> reader finds it, such as <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/man/man1</span></samp>.  If
you want to install the complete R tree to, e.g.,
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib/R</span></samp>, see <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>.  Note: you do not
<em>need</em> to install R: you can run it from where it was built.

   <p>You do not necessarily have to build R in the top-level source
directory (say, <samp><var>TOP_SRCDIR</var></samp>).  To build in
<samp><var>BUILDDIR</var></samp>, run

   <p><a name="index-configure-11"></a>
<pre class="example">     cd <var>BUILDDIR</var>
     <var>TOP_SRCDIR</var>/configure
     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and so on, as described further below.  This has the advantage of
always keeping your source tree clean and is particularly
recommended when you work with a version of R from Subversion. 
(You may need <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> to allow this, and the
pathname of the build directory should not contain spaces.)

   <p>For those obtaining R <em>via</em> Subversion, one additional step is
necessary:
<a name="index-Vignettes-12"></a><a name="index-Subversion-13"></a>
<pre class="example">     make vignettes
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which makes the <strong>grid</strong> vignettes (which are contained in the
tarballs): it make take several minutes.

   <p>Now <code>rehash</code> if necessary, type <kbd>R</kbd>, and read the R manuals
and the R <acronym>FAQ</acronym> (files <samp><span class="file">FAQ</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="file">doc/manual/R-FAQ.html</span></samp>, or
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html">http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html</a> which always
has the version for the latest release of R).

<p><a name="Help-options"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.2 Help options</h3>

<p>As from R 2.10.0, by default <acronym>HTML</acronym> help pages are created when
needed rather than being built at install time.

   <p>If you need to disable the server and want HTML help, there is the
option to continue to build <acronym>HTML</acronym> pages when packages are installed
(including those installed with R).  This is enabled by the
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> option <samp><span class="option">--enable-prebuilt-html</span></samp>.  Whether
<samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL</span></samp> (and hence <code>install.packages</code>) pre-builds
<acronym>HTML</acronym> pages is determined by looking at the R installation and is
reported by <samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL --help</span></samp>: it can be overridden by
specifying one of the <samp><span class="command">INSTALL</span></samp> options <samp><span class="option">--html</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">--no-html</span></samp>.

   <p>The server is disabled by setting the environment variable
<a name="index-R_005fDISABLE_005fHTTPD-14"></a><samp><span class="env">R_DISABLE_HTTPD</span></samp> to a non-empty value, either before R is
started or within the R session before <acronym>HTML</acronym> help (including
<code>help.start</code>) is used.  It is also possible that system security
measures will prevent the server from being started, for example if the
loopback interface has been disabled.  See
<code>?tools::startDynamicHelp</code> for more details.

<p><a name="Making-the-manuals"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.3 Making the manuals</h3>

<p><a name="index-Manuals-15"></a>
There is a set of manuals that can be built from the sources,

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">refman</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Printed versions of the help pages for the most-commonly-used base packages. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fullrefman</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Printed versions of all the help pages for base and recommended packages
(over 3000 pages). 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-FAQ</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>R <acronym>FAQ</acronym>
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-intro</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&ldquo;An Introduction to R&rdquo;. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-data</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&ldquo;R Data Import/Export&rdquo;. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-admin</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&ldquo;R Installation and Administration&rdquo;, this manual. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-exts</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo;. 
<br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-lang</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>&ldquo;The R Language Definition&rdquo;. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">To make these (except &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fullrefman</span></samp>&rsquo;), use

<pre class="example">     make dvi      <span class="roman">to create DVI versions</span>
     make pdf      <span class="roman">to create PDF versions</span>
     make info     <span class="roman">to create info files (not &lsquo;</span><samp><span class="samp">refman</span></samp><span class="roman">&rsquo;).</span>
</pre>
   <p>You will not be able to build any of these unless you have
<samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> version 4.7 or later installed, and for DVI or PDF
you must have <samp><span class="command">texi2dvi</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp> installed (which
are part of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> <strong>texinfo</strong> distribution but are,
especially <samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp>, often made part of the TeX package in
re-distributions).

   <p>The DVI versions can be previewed and printed using standard programs
such as <samp><span class="command">xdvi</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">dvips</span></samp>.  The PDF versions can be
viewed using any recent PDF viewer: they have hyperlinks that can be
followed.  The info files are suitable for reading online with Emacs or
the standalone <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">info</span></samp> program.  The DVI and PDF
versions will be created using the papersize selected at configuration
(default ISO a4): this can be overridden by setting <samp><span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span></samp>
<a name="index-R_005fPAPERSIZE-16"></a>on the <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> command line, or setting <samp><span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span></samp> in the
environment and using <samp><span class="command">make -e</span></samp>.  (If re-making the manuals for
a different papersize, you should first delete the file
<samp><span class="file">doc/manual/version.texi</span></samp>.)

   <p>There are some issues with making the reference manual, and in
particular with the PDF version <samp><span class="file">refman.pdf</span></samp>.  The help files
contain both ISO Latin1 characters (e.g. in <samp><span class="file">text.Rd</span></samp>) and
upright quotes, neither of which are contained in the standard LaTeX
Computer Modern fonts.  We have provided four alternatives:

     <dl>
<dt><code>times</code><dd>(The default for PDF.) Using standard PostScript fonts.  This works
well both for on-screen viewing and for printing. 
The one disadvantage is that the Usage and Examples sections may come
out rather wide.

     <br><dt><code>lm</code><dd>Using the <em>Latin Modern</em> fonts.  These are not often installed as
part of a TeX distribution, but can obtained from
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm/">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm/</a> and
mirrors.  This uses fonts rather similar to Computer Modern, but is not
so good on-screen as <code>times</code>.

     <br><dt><code>cm-super</code><dd>Using type-1 versions of the Computer Modern fonts by Vladimir Volovich. 
This is a large installation, obtainable from
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super/">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super/</a>
and its mirrors.  These type-1 fonts have poor hinting and so are
nowhere near so readable on-screen as the other three options.

     <br><dt><code>ae</code><dd>(The default for DVI.)  A package to use composites of Computer Modern
fonts.  This works well most of the time, and its PDF is more readable
on-screen than the previous two options.  There are three fonts for
which it will need to use bitmapped fonts, <samp><span class="file">tctt0900.600pk</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="file">tctt1000.600pk</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">tcrm1000.600pk</span></samp>.  Unfortunately, if
those files are not available, Acrobat Reader will substitute
completely incorrect glyphs so you need to examine the logs carefully. 
</dl>

   <p>The default can be overridden by setting the environment variables
<a name="index-R_005fRD4DVI-17"></a><a name="index-R_005fRD4PDF-18"></a><samp><span class="env">R_RD4PDF</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">R_RD4DVI</span></samp>.  (On Unix-alikes, these will be
picked up at install time and stored in <samp><span class="file">etc/Renviron</span></samp>, but can
still be overridden when the manuals are built.)  The default value for
<samp><span class="env">R_RD4PDF</span></samp> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">times,hyper</span></samp>&rsquo;: omit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">hyper</span></samp>&rsquo; if you do not
want hyperlinks, e.g. for printing.  The default for <samp><span class="env">R_RD4DVI</span></samp> is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ae</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<p><a name="Installation"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.4 Installation</h3>

<p><a name="index-Installation-19"></a>
To ensure that the installed tree is usable by the right group of users,
set <code>umask</code> appropriately (perhaps to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">022</span></samp>&rsquo;) before unpacking
the sources and throughout the build process.

   <p>After

   <p><a name="index-configure-20"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure
     make
     make check
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(or, when building outside the source,
<var>TOP_SRCDIR</var><code>/configure</code>, etc) have been completed
successfully, you can install the complete R tree to your system by
typing

<pre class="example">     make install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This will install to the following directories:

     <dl>
<dt><samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/bin</span></samp> or <samp><var>bindir</var></samp><dd>the front-end shell script and other scripts and executables
<br><dt><samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/man/man1</span></samp> or <samp><var>mandir</var><span class="file">/man1</span></samp><dd>the man page
<br><dt><samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/</span><var>LIBnn</var><span class="file">/R</span></samp> or <samp><var>libdir</var><span class="file">/R</span></samp><dd>all the rest (libraries, on-line help system, <small class="dots">...</small>).  Here
<var>LIBnn</var> is usually &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib</span></samp>&rsquo;, but may be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lib64</span></samp>&rsquo; on some
64-bit Linux systems.  This is known as the R home directory. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">where <var>prefix</var> is determined during configuration (typically
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp>) and can be set by running <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> with
the option <samp><span class="option">--prefix</span></samp>, as in

   <p><a name="index-configure-21"></a>
<pre class="example">     ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/R/to/go
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This causes <samp><span class="command">make install</span></samp> to install the R script to
<samp><span class="file">/where/you/want/R/to/go/bin</span></samp>, and so on.  The prefix of the
installation directories can be seen in the status message that is
displayed at the end of <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  You can install into
another directory tree by using

<pre class="example">     make prefix=/path/to/here install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">at least with <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> (but not e.g. Solaris 8's
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>).

   <p>More precise control is available at configure time via options: see
<samp><span class="command">configure --help</span></samp> for details.  (However, most of the `Fine
tuning of the installation directories' options are not used by R.)

   <p>Configure options <samp><span class="option">--bindir</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">--mandir</span></samp> are supported
and govern where a copy of the <samp><span class="command">R</span></samp> script and the <samp><span class="command">man</span></samp>
page are installed.

   <p>The configure option <samp><span class="option">--libdir</span></samp> controls where the main R
files are installed: the default is &lsquo;<samp><var>eprefix</var><span class="samp">/</span><var>LIBnn</var></samp>&rsquo;,
where <var>eprefix</var> is the prefix used for installing
architecture-dependent files, defaults to <var>prefix</var>, and can be set
via the configure option <samp><span class="option">--exec-prefix</span></samp>.

   <p>Each of <code>bindir</code>, <code>mandir</code> and <code>libdir</code> can also be
specified on the <samp><span class="command">make install</span></samp> command line (at least for
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>).

   <p>The <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> variables <code>rdocdir</code> and
<code>rsharedir</code> can be used to install the system-independent
<samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">share</span></samp> directories to somewhere other than
<code>libdir</code>.  The C header files can be installed to the value of
<code>rincludedir</code>: note that as the headers are not installed into a
subdirectory you probably want something like
<code>rincludedir=/usr/local/include/R-2.12.2</code>.

   <p>If you want the R home to be something other than
<samp><var>libdir</var><span class="file">/R</span></samp>, use <samp><span class="option">rhome</span></samp>: for example

<pre class="example">     make install rhome=/usr/local/lib64/R-2.11.0
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will use a version-specific R home on a Linux 64-bit system.

   <p>If you have made R as a shared/dynamic library you can install it in
your system's library directory by

<pre class="example">     make prefix=/path/to/here install-libR
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <code>prefix</code> is optional, and <code>libdir</code> will give more
precise control.

<pre class="example">     make install-strip
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will install stripped executables, and on platforms where this is
supported, stripped libraries in directories <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">modules</span></samp> and in the standard packages.

   <p><a name="index-Manuals_002c-installing-22"></a>
To install DVI, info and PDF versions of the manuals, use one or more of

<pre class="example">     make install-dvi
     make install-info
     make install-pdf
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Once again, it is optional to specify <code>prefix</code>, <code>libdir</code> or
<code>rhome</code> (the DVI and PDF manuals are installed under the R home
directory).  (<samp><span class="command">make install-info</span></samp> needs Perl installed if there
is no command <samp><span class="command">install-info</span></samp> on the system.)

   <p>More precise control is possible.  For info, the setting used is that of
<code>infodir</code> (default <samp><var>prefix</var><span class="file">/info</span></samp>, set by configure
option <samp><span class="option">--infodir</span></samp>).  The DVI and PDF files are installed into
the R <samp><span class="file">doc</span></samp> tree, set by the <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> variable
<code>rdocdir</code>.

   <p>A staged installation is possible, that it is installing R into a
temporary directory in order to move the installed tree to its final
destination.  In this case <code>prefix</code> (and so on) should reflect the
<a name="index-DESTDIR-23"></a>final destination, and <samp><span class="env">DESTDIR</span></samp> should be used: see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html">http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html</a>.

   <p>You can optionally install the run-time tests that are part of
<samp><span class="command">make check-all</span></samp> by

<pre class="example">     make install-tests
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which populates a <samp><span class="file">tests</span></samp> directory in the installation.

<p><a name="Uninstallation"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.5 Uninstallation</h3>

<p>You can uninstall R by

<pre class="example">     make uninstall
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">optionally specifying <code>prefix</code> etc in the same way as specified for
installation.

   <p>This will also uninstall any installed manuals.  There are specific
targets to uninstall DVI, info and PDF manuals in file
<samp><span class="file">doc/manual/Makefile</span></samp>.

   <p>Target <code>uninstall-tests</code> will uninstall any installed tests, as
well as removing the directory <samp><span class="file">tests</span></samp> containing the test results.

<p><a name="Sub-architectures"></a>
<a name="Sub_002darchitectures"></a>

<h3 class="section">2.6 Sub-architectures</h3>

<p>Some platforms can support closely related builds of R which can
share all but the executables and dynamic objects.  Examples include
builds under Solaris for different chips (in particular, 32- and 64-bit
builds), 64- and 32- bit builds on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux and different
<acronym>CPU</acronym>s (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ppc</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i386</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo;) under Mac OS &gt;= 10.4.

   <p>R supports the idea of architecture-specific builds, specified by
adding &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r_arch=</span><var>name</var></samp>&rsquo; to the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> line.  Here
<var>name</var> can be anything non-empty, and is used to name subdirectories
of <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">etc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">include</span></samp> and the package <samp><span class="file">libs</span></samp>
subdirectories.  Example names from other systems are the use of
<samp><span class="file">sparcv9</span></samp> on Sparc Solaris and <samp><span class="file">32</span></samp> by <code>gcc</code> on
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux.

   <p>If you have two or more such builds you can install them over each other
(and for 32/64-bit builds on one architecture, one build can be done
without &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r_arch</span></samp>&rsquo;).  The space savings can be considerable: on
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux a basic install (without debugging symbols) took
63Mb, and adding a 32-bit build added 6Mb.  If you have installed
multiple builds you can select which build to run by

<pre class="example">     R --arch=<var>name</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and just running &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; will run the last build that was installed.

   <p><code>R CMD INSTALL</code> will detect if more than one build is installed and
try to install packages with the appropriate library objects for each. 
This will not be done if the package has an executable <code>configure</code>
script or a <samp><span class="file">src/Makefile</span></samp> file.  In such cases you can install for
extra builds by

<pre class="example">     R --arch=<var>name</var> CMD INSTALL --libs-only <var>pkg(s)</var>
</pre>
   <p>If you want to mix sub-architectures compiled on different platforms
(for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i686</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux), it is
wise to use explicit names for each, and you may also need to set
<samp><span class="option">libdir</span></samp> to ensure that they install into the same place.

   <p>When sub-architectures are used the version of <samp><span class="command">Rscript</span></samp> in
e.g. <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin</span></samp> will be the last installed, but
architecture-specific versions will be available in e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib64/R/bin/exec${</span><var>R_ARCH</var><span class="file">}</span></samp>.  Normally all installed
architectures will run on the platform so the architecture of
<samp><span class="command">Rscript</span></samp> itself does not matter.  The executable
<samp><span class="command">Rscript</span></samp> will run the <samp><span class="command">R</span></samp> script, and at that time the
<a name="index-R_005fARCH-24"></a>setting of the <samp><span class="env">R_ARCH</span></samp> environment variable determines the
architecture which is run.

   <p>When running post-install tests with sub-architectures, use

<pre class="example">     R --arch=<var>name</var> CMD make check[-devel|all]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to select a sub-architecture to check.

   <p>Sub-architectures are also used on Windows, but by selecting executables
within the appropriate <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp> directory,
<samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin/i386</span></samp> or <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin/x64</span></samp>.  For
backwards compatibility with R &lt; 2.12.0, there are executables
<samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin/R.exe</span></samp> or <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin/Rscript.exe</span></samp>:
these will run an executable from one of the subdirectories, which being
<a name="index-R_005fARCH-25"></a>taken first from the <samp><span class="env">R_ARCH</span></samp> environment variable, then from the
<samp><span class="option">--arch</span></samp> command-line option<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-3" name="fnd-3"><sup>3</sup></a> and finally from the
installation default (which is 32-bit for a combined 32/64 bit R
installation).

<p><a name="Multilib"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">2.6.1 Multilib</h4>

<p>On Linux, there is an alternative mechanism for mixing 32-bit and
64-bit libraries known as <em>multilib</em>. If a Linux distribution supports
multilib, then parallel builds of R may be installed in the
sub-directories <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> (32-bit) and <samp><span class="file">lib64</span></samp> (64-bit).  The
build to be run may then be chosen using the <samp><span class="command">setarch</span></samp>
command. For example, a 32-bit build may be chosen by

<pre class="example">     setarch i686 R
</pre>
   <p>The <samp><span class="command">setarch</span></samp> command is only operational if both 32-bit and
64-bit builds are installed. If there is only one installation of R,
then this will always be run regardless of the architecture specified
by the <samp><span class="command">setarch</span></samp> command.

   <p>There can be problems with installing packages on the non-native
architecture.  It is a good idea to run e.g. <code>setarch i686 R</code> for
sessions in which packages are to be installed, even if that is the only
version of R installed (since this tells the package installation
code the architecture needed).

   <p>At present there is a potential problem with packages using Java, as
the post-install for a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i386</span></samp>&rsquo; RPM on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux
reconfigures Java and will find the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Java.  If you know
where a 32-bit Java is installed you may be able to run (as root)

<pre class="example">     export JAVA_HOME=&lt;path to jre directory of 32-bit Java&gt;
     setarch i686 R CMD javareconf
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to get a suitable setting.

   <p>When this mechanism is used, the version of <samp><span class="command">Rscript</span></samp> in
e.g. <samp><span class="file">/usr/bin</span></samp> will be the last installed, but an
architecture-specific version will be available in
e.g. <samp><span class="file">/usr/lib64/R/bin</span></samp>.  Normally all installed architectures
will run on the platform so the architecture of <samp><span class="command">Rscript</span></samp> does
not matter.

<h3 class="section">2.7 Testing an Installation</h3>

<p>Full testing is possible only if the test files have been installed with

<pre class="example">     make install-tests
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which populates a <samp><span class="file">tests</span></samp> directory in the installation.

   <p>If this has been done, two testing routes are available. 
The first is to move to the home directory of the R installation
(as given by <code>R.home()</code>) and run

<pre class="example">     cd tests
     ## followed by one of
     ../bin/R CMD make check
     ../bin/R CMD make check-devel
     ../bin/R CMD make check-all
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and other useful targets are <code>test-BasePackages</code> and
<code>test-Recommended</code> to the run tests of the standard and
recommended packages (if installed) respectively.

   <p>This re-runs all the tests relevant to the installed R (including for
example code in the package vignettes), but not for example the ones
checking the example code in the manuals nor making the standalone Rmath
library.  This can occasionally be useful when the operating environment
has been changed, for example by OS updates or by substituting the
<acronym>BLAS</acronym> (see <a href="#Shared-BLAS">Shared BLAS</a>).

   <p>Alternatively, the installed R can be run, preferably with
<samp><span class="option">--vanilla</span></samp>.  Then

<pre class="example">     library("tools")
     testInstalledBasic("both")
     testInstalledPackages(scope = "base")
     testInstalledPackages(scope = "recommended")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">runs the basic tests and then all the tests on the standard and
recommended packages.  These tests can be run from anywhere: the basic
tests write their results in the <samp><span class="file">tests</span></samp> folder of the R home
directory and run slightly fewer tests than the first approach: in
particular they do not test Internet access.

   <p>These tests work best if <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> (in <samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp> for
Windows users) is in the path, and on some systems need the collation
locale set manually (the R code tries to do so but it may not be
possible to reset it): so if needed try setting the environment variable
<samp><span class="env">LC_COLLATE</span></samp> to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo; before starting R. 
<a name="index-LC_005fCOLLATE-26"></a>
It is possible to test the installed packages (but not the
package-specific tests) by <code>testInstalledPackages</code> even if
<samp><span class="command">make install-tests</span></samp> was not run.

   <p>Note that the results may depend on the language set for times and
messages: for maximal similarity to reference results you may want to
try setting

<pre class="example">     LANGUAGE=en LC_TIME=C

<h2 class="chapter">3 Installing R under Windows</h2>

<p><a name="index-Installing-under-Windows-27"></a>
The <samp><span class="file">bin/windows</span></samp> directory of a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> site contains
binaries for a base distribution and a large number of add-on packages
from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> to run on Windows 2000 or later on ix86
<acronym>CPU</acronym>s (including AMD64/Intel64<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-4" name="fnd-4"><sup>4</sup></a> chips and Windows x64).

   <p>Your file system must allow long file names (as is likely except
perhaps for some network-mounted systems).

   <p>Installation is <em>via</em> the installer
<samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2-win.exe</span></samp>.  Just double-click on the icon and
follow the instructions.  When installing on a 64-bit version of Windows
the options will include 32- or 64-bit versions of R (and the default is
to install both).  You can uninstall R from the Control Panel or from
the (optional) R program group on the Start Menu.

   <p>Note that you will be asked to choose a language for installation, and
that choice applies to both installation and un-installation but not to
running R itself.

   <p>See the <a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html">R Windows <acronym>FAQ</acronym></a> for more details on the binary installer.

<p><a name="Building-from-source"></a>

<h3 class="section">3.1 Building from source</h3>

<p>R can be built as either a 32-bit or 64-bit application on Windows:
to build the 64-bit application you need a 64-bit edition of Windows:
such an OS can also be used to build 32-bit \R.

   <p>The standard installer combines 32-bit and 64-bit builds into a single
executable which can then be installed into the same location and share
all the files except the <samp><span class="file">.exe</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.dll</span></samp> files and some
configuration files in the <samp><span class="file">etc</span></samp> directory.

<p><a name="Getting-the-tools"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.1 Getting the tools</h4>

<p>If you want to build R from the sources, you will first need to
collect, install and test an extensive set of tools.  See <a href="#The-Windows-toolset">The Windows toolset</a> (and perhaps updates in
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/</a>) for details.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp> executable installer described in <a href="#The-Windows-toolset">The Windows toolset</a> also includes some source files in addition to the R source
as noted below. You should run it first, to obtain a working <code>tar</code>
and other necessities.  Choose a &ldquo;Full installation&rdquo;, and install the
extra files into your intended R source directory, e.g. 
<samp><span class="file">C:/R</span></samp>. The directory name <em>should not contain spaces</em>. We
will call this directory <samp><var>R_HOME</var></samp> below.

   <p>For a 64-bit build you will need a 64-bit toolchain and the appropriate
64-bit version of Tcl/Tk: both of these are contained in
<samp><span class="file">Rtools212.exe</span></samp>.

<p><a name="Getting-the-source-files"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.2 Getting the source files</h4>

<p>You need to collect the following sets of files:
     <ul>
<li>Get the R source code tarball <samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2.tar.gz</span></samp> from
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  Open a command window (or another shell) at directory
<var>R_HOME</var>, and run

     <pre class="example">          tar -xf R-2.12.2.tar.gz
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">to create the source tree in <var>R_HOME</var>.  <strong>Beware</strong>: do use
<samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> to extract the sources rather than tools such as WinZip
that do not understand symbolic links.  If you are using an account with
administrative privileges you may get a lot of messages which can be
suppressed by

     <pre class="example">          tar --no-same-owner -xf R-2.12.2.tar.gz
</pre>
     <p class="noindent"><a name="index-TAR_005fOPTIONS-28"></a>or perhaps better, set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">TAR_OPTIONS</span></samp> to the
value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--no-same-owner --no-same-permissions</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p>It is also possible to obtain the source code using Subversion; see
<a href="#Obtaining-R">Obtaining R</a> for details.

     <li>If you are not using a tarball you need to obtain copies of the
recommended packages from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  Put the <samp><span class="file">.tar.gz</span></samp> files
in <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/library/Recommended</span></samp> and run <code>make
link-recommended</code>.  If you have an Internet connection, you can do this
automatically by running in <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32</span></samp>

     <pre class="example">          make rsync-recommended
</pre>
     </ul>

   <p>The following additional items are normally installed by
<samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp>.  If instead you choose to do a completely manual
build you will also need

     <ul>
<li>The Tcl/Tk support files are contained in <samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp>. 
Please make sure you install the right version: there is a 32-bit version
and a 64-bit version.

     <li>You need <code>libpng</code>, <code>jpeg</code> and <code>libtiff</code> sources
(available, e.g., from <a href="http://www.libpng.org/">http://www.libpng.org/</a>,
<a href="http://www.ijg.org">http://www.ijg.org</a> and
<a href="ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff/">ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff/</a>).  You will need
files <samp><span class="file">libpng-1.2.18.tar.gz</span></samp> (including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.4.x</span></samp>&rsquo; but not
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">1.5.x</span></samp>&rsquo;), <samp><span class="file">jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">tiff-3.8.0.tar.gz</span></samp> (but
not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">4.0.0beta</span></samp>&rsquo;) or later.

     <p>Working in the directory <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/bitmap</span></samp>,
install the <code>libpng</code> and <code>jpeg</code> sources in sub-directories. 
The <code>jpeg</code> sub-directory for version 8b is named <samp><span class="file">jpeg-8b</span></samp>; if
you use a different version (e.g. <samp><span class="file">jpeg-6b</span></samp>), copy file
<samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/MkRules.local</span></samp>
and edit the definition of <code>JPEGDIR</code>: the names of the
<samp><span class="file">libpng</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">libtiff</span></samp> directories can also be set there.

     <p>Example:

     <pre class="example">          &gt; tar -zxf libpng-1.4.5.tar.gz
          &gt; mv libpng-1.4.5 libpng
          &gt; tar -zxf jpegsrc.v8c.tar.gz
          &gt; tar -zxf tiff-3.9.4.tar.gz
          &gt; mv tiff-3.9.4/libtiff .
          &gt; rm -rf tiff-3.9.4
</pre>

<p><a name="Building-the-core-files"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.3 Building the core files</h4>

<p><a name="index-TMPDIR-29"></a>Set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp> to point to a writable
directory, with a path specified with forward slashes and no spaces. 
(The default is <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp>, which may not be useful on Windows.)

   <p>You may need to compile under a case-honouring file system: we found
that a <samp><span class="command">samba</span></samp>-mounted file system (which maps all file names to
lower case) did not work.

   <p>Open a command window at <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32</span></samp>.  Look at
<samp><span class="file">MkRules.dist</span></samp> and if settings need to be altered, copy it to
<samp><span class="file">MkRules.local</span></samp> and edit the settings there.  In particular, this
is where a 64-bit build is selected.  Then run

<pre class="example">     make all recommended
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and sit back and wait while the basic compile takes place.

   <p>Notes:
     <ul>
<li>We have had reports that earlier versions of anti-virus software locking
up the machine, but not for several years.  However, aggressive
anti-virus checking such as the on-access scanning of Sophos can slow
the build down several-fold.

     <li>By default Doug Lea's <code>malloc</code> in the file
<samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/src/gnuwin32/malloc.c</span></samp> is used for R's internal
memory allocations.  You can opt out of this by setting
<code>LEA_MALLOC=NO</code> in <samp><span class="file">MkRules.dist</span></samp>, in which case the <code>malloc</code>
in <samp><span class="file">msvcrt.dll</span></samp> is used.  This does impose a considerable
performance penalty and has not been tested recently.

     <li>You can run a parallel make by e.g.

     <pre class="example">          make -j4 all
          make -j4 recommended
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">but this is only likely to be worthwhile on a multi-core machine with
ample memory, and is not 100% reliable.

options such as the paper size.

<p><a name="Building-the-Inno-Setup-installer"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.7 Building the Inno Setup installer</h4>

<p>You need to have the files for a complete R build, including bitmap and
Tcl/Tk support and the manuals, as well as the recommended packages and
Inno Setup (see <a href="#The-Inno-Setup-installer">The Inno Setup installer</a>).

   <p>Once everything is set up

<pre class="example">     make distribution
     make check-all
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will make all the pieces and the installers and put them in the
<samp><span class="file">gnuwin32/cran</span></samp> subdirectory, then check the build.  This works by
building all the parts in the sequence:

<pre class="example">     Rpwd.exe <span class="roman">(a utility needed in the build)</span>
     rbuild <span class="roman">(the executables, the <acronym>FAQ</acronym> docs etc.)</span>
     rpackage <span class="roman">(the base packages)</span>
     htmldocs <span class="roman">(the HTML documentation)</span>
     bitmapdll <span class="roman">(the bitmap support files)</span>
     recommended <span class="roman">(the recommended packages)</span>
     vignettes <span class="roman">(the vignettes in package </span><strong>grid</strong><span class="roman">:</span>
     	  <span class="roman"> only needed if building from an svn checkout)</span>
     manuals <span class="roman">(the PDF manuals)</span>
     rinstaller <span class="roman">(the install program)</span>
     crandir <span class="roman">(the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> distribution directory, only for 64-bit builds)</span>
</pre>
   <p>The parts can be made individually if a full build is not needed, but
earlier parts must be built before later ones.  (The <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp>
doesn't enforce this dependency&mdash;some build targets force a lot of
computation even if all files are up to date.)  The first four targets
are the default build if just <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> (or <samp><span class="command">make all</span></samp>) is
run.

   <p>If you want to customize the installation by adding extra packages,
replace <code>make rinstaller</code> by something like

<pre class="example">     make rinstaller EXTRA_PKGS='pkg1 pkg2 pkg3'
</pre>
   <p>An alternative way to customize the installer starting with a binary
distribution is to first make a full installation of R from the standard
installer (that is, select &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Full Installation</span></samp>&rsquo; from the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Select Components</span></samp>&rsquo; screen), then add packages and make other
customizations to that installation.  Then (after having customized file
<samp><span class="file">MkRules</span></samp>, possibly <em>via</em> <samp><span class="file">MkRules.local</span></samp>, and having
made R in the source tree) in <samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/installer</span></samp> run

<pre class="example">     make myR IMAGEDIR=rootdir
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <samp><span class="file">rootdir</span></samp> is the path to the root of the customized
installation (in double quotes if it contains spaces or backslashes).

   <p>Both methods create an executable with a standard name such as
<samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2-win.exe</span></samp>, so please rename it to indicate that
it is customized.  If you intend to <em>distribute</em> a customized
installer please do check that license requirements are met &ndash; note that
the installer will state that the contents are distributed under GPL-2
and this has a requirement for <em>you</em> to supply the complete sources
(including the R sources even if you started with a binary distribution
of R, and also the sources of libraries which are included).

   <p>The defaults for the startup parameters may also be customized.  For example

<pre class="example">     make myR IMAGEDIR=rootdir MDISDI=1
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will create an installer that defaults to installing R to run in SDI
mode.  See <samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/installer/Makefile</span></samp> for the names and
values that can be set.

   <p>The standard CRAN distribution of a 32/64-bit installer is made by first
building 32-bit R (just

<pre class="example">     make all recommended bitmapdll
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is needed), and then building 64-bit R with the macro <code>HOME32</code> set
in file <samp><span class="file">MkRules.local</span></samp> to the top-level directory of the 32-bit
build.  Then the <samp><span class="command">make rinstaller</span></samp> step copies the files that
differ between architectures from the 32-bit build as it builds the
installer image.

<p><a name="Building-the-MSI-installer"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.8 Building the MSI installer</h4>

<p>It is also possible to build an installer for use with Microsoft
Installer.  This is intended for use by sysadmins doing automated
installs, and is not recommended for casual use.

   <p>It makes use of the Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolkit <em>version
3.0 or 3.5</em> available from <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/">http://wix.sourceforge.net/</a>.  Once WiX
is installed, set the path to its home directory in
<samp><span class="file">MkRules.local</span></samp>.

   <p>You need to have the files for a complete R build, including bitmap and
Tcl/Tk support and the manuals, as well as the recommended packages. 
There is no option in the installer to customize startup options, so
edit <samp><span class="file">etc/Rconsole</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">etc/Rprofile.site</span></samp> to set these as
required.  Then

<pre class="example">     cd installer
     make msi
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which will results in a file with a name like
<samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2-win32.msi</span></samp>.  This can be double-clicked to be
installed, but those who need it will know what to do with it (usually
by running <samp><span class="command">msiexec /i</span></samp> with additional options).  Properties
that users might want to set from the <samp><span class="command">msiexec</span></samp> command line
include &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ALLUSERS</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">INSTALLDIR</span></samp>&rsquo; (something like
<samp><span class="file">c:\Program Files\R\R-2.12.2</span></samp>) and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">RMENU</span></samp>&rsquo; (the path
to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; folder on the start menu) and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">STARTDIR</span></samp>&rsquo; (the
starting directory for R shortcuts, defaulting to something like
<samp><span class="file">c:\Users\name\Documents\R</span></samp>).

   <p>As from R 2.12.1 the MSI installer can be built both from a 32-bit
build of R (<samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2-win32.msi</span></samp>) and from a 64-bit
build of R (<samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2-win64.msi</span></samp>, optionally including
32-bit files by setting the macro <code>HOME32</code>, when the name is
<samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2-win.msi</span></samp>).  Unlike the main installer, a 64-bit
MSI installer can only be run on 64-bit Windows.

for suggesting WiX and building a prototype installer.

<h4 class="subsection">3.1.10 64-bit Windows builds</h4>

<p>To build a 64-bit version of R you need a 64-bit toolchain: the only one
discussed here (see <a href="#g_t64_002dbit-toolchain">64-bit toolchain</a>) is based on the work of
the MinGW-w64 project
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/</a>, but commercial
compilers such as those from Intel and PGI could be used (and have been
by R redistributors).

   <p>Support for MinGW-w64 was developed in the R sources over the period
2008&ndash;10 and was first released as part of R 2.11.0.  The assistance
of Yu Gong at a crucial step in porting R to MinGW-w64 is gratefully
acknowledged, as well as help from Kai Tietz, the lead developer of the
MinGW-w64 project.

<p><a name="Testing-a-Windows-Installation"></a>

<h3 class="section">3.2 Testing an Installation</h3>

<p>The Windows installer contains a set of test files used when building
R.  These are an optional part of the installation, and if it is
desired to run tests on the installation these should be selected as
well as the help source files (perhaps most easily by doing a `Full
Installation').

   <p>The <code>Rtools</code> are not needed to run these tests. but more
comprehensive analysis of errors will be given if <samp><span class="command">diff</span></samp> is in
the path.

   <p>Once this has been done, launch either <code>Rgui</code> or <code>Rterm</code>,
preferably with <samp><span class="option">--vanilla</span></samp>.  Then

     testInstalledBasic("both")
     testInstalledPackages("base")
     testInstalledPackages("recommended")
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">runs the basic tests and then all the tests on the standard and
recommended packages.  These tests can be run from anywhere: they write
their results in the <samp><span class="file">tests</span></samp> folder of the R home directory (as

   <p class="noindent">and then sit back and wait.  The first two options are the default and
use the BLAS and LAPACK built into Mac OS X.  This has pros and cons: it
used to be faster (but has not been on some recent multicore hardware)
but less accurate.

   <p>The second line of options are also default on Mac OS X, but needed only
if you want to build R for use with <code>R.app</code> Console, and imply
<samp><span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span></samp> to build R as a shared/dynamic library. 
These options configure R to be built and installed as a framework
called <samp><span class="file">R.framework</span></samp>.  The default installation path for
<samp><span class="file">R.framework</span></samp> is <samp><span class="file">/Library/Frameworks</span></samp> but this can be changed
at configure time by specifying the flag
<samp><span class="option">--enable-R-framework[=</span><var>DIR</var><span class="option">]</span></samp> or at install time as

<pre class="example">     make prefix=/where/you/want/R.framework/to/go install
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(the final <samp><span class="file">R.framework</span></samp> directory should not be included in the
path).

   <p>For compatibility with the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> distribution you may need to
specify <samp><span class="option">--with-included-gettext</span></samp> to avoid linking against a
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libintl</span></samp>&rsquo; dynamic library you may have available, for example in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib</span></samp>.

   <p>Note that building the <samp><span class="file">R.app</span></samp> GUI console is a separate project:
see the Mac OS X FAQ for details.

<p><a name="Running-R"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Running R</h2>

<p>How to start R and what command-line options are available is discussed
in <a href="R-intro.html#Invoking-R">Invoking R</a>.

   <p>You should ensure that the shell has set adequate resource limits: R
expects a stack size of at least 8MB and to be able to open at least 256
file descriptors.  (Any modern OS will have default limits at least as
large as these, but apparently NetBSD does not.  Use the shell command
<samp><span class="command">ulimit</span></samp> (<samp><span class="command">sh</span></samp>/<samp><span class="command">bash</span></samp>) or <samp><span class="command">limit</span></samp>
(<samp><span class="command">csh</span></samp>/<samp><span class="command">tcsh</span></samp>) to check.)

   <p>R makes use of a number of environment variables, the default values
of many of which are set in file <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/etc/Renviron</span></samp> (there
are none set by default on Windows and hence no such file).  These are
set at <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> time, and you would not normally want to
<a name="index-R_005fPAPERSIZE-32"></a>change them &ndash; a possible exception is <samp><span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span></samp> (see <a href="#Setting-paper-size">Setting paper size</a>).  The paper size will be deduced from the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LC_PAPER</span></samp>&rsquo;
locale category if it exists and <samp><span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span></samp> is unset, and this
will normally produce the right choice from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a4</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">letter</span></samp>&rsquo;
on modern Unix-alikes (but can always be overridden by setting
<samp><span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span></samp>).

   <p>Various environment variables can be set to determine where R creates
its per-session temporary directory.  The environment variables
<a name="index-TMPDIR-33"></a><a name="index-TMP-34"></a><a name="index-TEMP-35"></a><samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">TMP</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">TEMP</span></samp> are searched in turn and the
first one which is set and points to a writable area is used.  If none
do, the final default is <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> on Unix-alikes and the value of
<a name="index-R_005fUSER-36"></a><samp><span class="env">R_USER</span></samp> on Windows.

   <p>Some Unix-alike systems are set up to remove files and directories
periodically from <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp>, for example by a <samp><span class="command">cron</span></samp> job
<a name="index-TMPDIR-37"></a>running <samp><span class="command">tmpwatch</span></samp>.  Set <samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp> to another directory
before running long-running jobs on such a system.

   <p>Note that <samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp> will be used to execute <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
scripts when installing packages, so if <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> has been mounted as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">noexec</span></samp>&rsquo;, <samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp> needs to be set to a directory from which
execution is allowed.

<a name="Add_002don-packages"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">6 Add-on packages</h2>

<p><a name="index-Packages-38"></a><a name="index-Libraries-39"></a>

   <p>It is helpful to use the correct terminology.  A <em>package</em> is
loaded from a <em>library</em> by the function <code>library()</code>.  Thus a
library is a directory containing installed packages; the main library
is <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/library</span></samp>, but others can be used, for example by
<a name="index-R_005fLIBS-40"></a>setting the environment variable <samp><span class="env">R_LIBS</span></samp> or using the R function
<code>.libPaths()</code>.

<p><a name="Default-packages"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.1 Default packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-Packages_002c-default-41"></a>
The set of packages loaded on startup is by default

<pre class="example">     &gt; getOption("defaultPackages")
     [1] "datasets"  "utils"     "grDevices" "graphics"  "stats"     "methods"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(plus, of course, <strong>base</strong>) and this can be changed by setting the
option in startup code (e.g. in <samp><span class="file">~/.Rprofile</span></samp>).  It is initially
<a name="index-R_005fDEFAULT_005fPACKAGES-42"></a>set to the value of the environment variable <samp><span class="env">R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES</span></samp> if
set (as a comma-separated list).  Setting <samp><span class="env">R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL</span></samp>
ensures that only package <strong>base</strong> is loaded.

   <p>Changing the set of default packages is normally used to reduce the set
for speed when scripting: in particular not using <strong>methods</strong> will
reduce the start-up time by a factor of up to two (and this is done by
<samp><span class="command">Rscript</span></samp>).  But it can also be used to customize R, e.g. 
for class use.

<p><a name="Managing-libraries"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.2 Managing libraries</h3>

<p><a name="index-Libraries_002c-managing-43"></a>
R packages are installed into <em>libraries</em>, which are
directories in the file system containing a subdirectory for each
package installed there.

   <p>R comes with a single library, <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/library</span></samp> which is
the value of the R object &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.Library</span></samp>&rsquo; containing the standard and
recommended<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-5" name="fnd-5"><sup>5</sup></a>  packages. 
Both sites and users can create others and make use of them (or not) in
an R session.  At the lowest level &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.libPaths()</span></samp>&rsquo; can be used to
add paths to the collection of libraries or to report the current
collection.

   <p><a name="index-Libraries_002c-site-44"></a><a name="index-Site-libraries-45"></a>R will automatically make use of a site-specific library
<samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/site-library</span></samp> if this exists (it does not in a
vanilla R installation).  This location can be overridden by
setting<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-6" name="fnd-6"><sup>6</sup></a> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.Library.site</span></samp>&rsquo; in
<samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/etc/Rprofile.site</span></samp>, or (not recommended) by setting
the
<a name="index-R_005fLIBS_005fSITE-46"></a>environment variable <samp><span class="env">R_LIBS_SITE</span></samp>.  Like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.Library</span></samp>&rsquo;, the
site libraries are always included by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.libPaths()</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p><a name="index-Libraries_002c-user-47"></a><a name="index-User-libraries-48"></a><a name="index-R_005fLIBS_005fUSER-49"></a>Users can have one or more libraries, normally specified by the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">R_LIBS_USER</span></samp>.  This has a default value (use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")</span></samp>&rsquo; within an R session to see what it
is), but only is used if the corresponding directory actually exists
(which by default it will not).

   <p>Both <samp><span class="env">R_LIBS_USER</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">R_LIBS_SITE</span></samp> can specify multiple
library paths, separated by colons (semicolons on Windows).

<p><a name="Installing-packages"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.3 Installing packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-Packages_002c-installing-50"></a>

   <p>Packages may be distributed in source form or compiled binary form. 
Installing source packages which contain C/C++/Fortran code requires
that compilers and related tools be installed.  Binary packages are
platform-specific and generally need no special tools to install, but
see the documentation for your platform for details.

   <p>Note that you may need to specify implicitly or explicitly the library to
which the package is to be installed.  This is only an issue if you have
more than one library, of course.

   <p>If installing packages on a Unix-alike to be used by other users, ensure
that the system <code>umask</code> is set to give sufficient permissions (see
also <code>Sys.umask</code> in R).

   <p>For most users it suffices to call
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">install.packages(</span><var>pkgname</var><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo; or its GUI equivalent if the
intention is to install a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> package and internet access is
available.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-7" name="fnd-7"><sup>7</sup></a>  On most systems &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">install.packages()</span></samp>&rsquo;
will allow packages to be selected from a list box.

   <p>To install packages from source in a Unix-alike use

<pre class="example">     R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/library <var>pkg1</var> <var>pkg2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The part &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l /path/to/library</span></samp>&rsquo; can be omitted, in which case the
first library of a normal R session is used (that shown by
<code>.libPaths()[1]</code>).

   <p><a name="index-TMPDIR-51"></a>Ensure that the environment variable <samp><span class="env">TMPDIR</span></samp> is either unset (and
<samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp> exists and can be written in and executed from) or points to
a valid temporary directory.

   <p>There are a number of options available: use <code>R CMD INSTALL --help</code>
to see the current list.

   <p><a name="index-install_002epackages-52"></a>Alternatively, packages can be downloaded and installed from within
R.  First set the option <code>CRAN</code> to your nearest <acronym>CRAN</acronym>
mirror using <samp><span class="command">chooseCRANmirror()</span></samp>.  Then download
and install packages <strong>pkg1</strong> and <strong>pkg2</strong> by

<pre class="example">     &gt; install.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2"))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The essential dependencies of the specified packages will also be fetched. 
Unless the library is specified (argument <code>lib</code>) the first library
in the library search path is used: if this is not writable, R will
ask the user (in an interactive session) if the default user library
should be created, and if allowed to will install the packages there.

   <p>If you want to fetch a package and all those it depends on (in any way)
that are not already installed, use e.g.

<pre class="example">     &gt; install.packages("Rcmdr", dependencies = TRUE)
</pre>
   <p><code>install.packages</code> can install a source package from a local
<samp><span class="file">.tar.gz</span></samp> file by setting argument <code>repos</code> to <code>NULL</code>:
this will be selected automatically if the name given is a single
<samp><span class="file">.tar.gz</span></samp> file.

   <p><code>install.packages</code> can look in several repositories, specified as a
character vector by the argument <code>repos</code>: these can include a
<acronym>CRAN</acronym> mirror, Bioconductor, Omegahat, R-forge, local archives,
local files, <small class="dots">...</small>).  Function <code>setRepositories()</code> can select
amongst those repositories that the R installation is aware of.

   <p>Naive users sometimes forget that as well as installing a package, they
have to use <code>library</code> to make its functionality available.

<p><a name="Windows-packages"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.1 Windows</h4>

<p>What <code>install.packages</code> does by default is different on Unix-alikes
(except Mac OS X) and Windows.  On Unix-alikes it consults the list of
available <em>source</em> packages on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> (or other
repository/ies), downloads the latest version of the package sources,
and installs them (via <code>R CMD INSTALL</code>).  On Windows it looks (by
default) at the list of <em>binary</em> versions of packages available for
your version of R and downloads the latest versions (if any),
although optionally it will also download and install a source package
by setting the <code>type</code> argument.

   <p>On Windows <code>install.packages</code> can also install a binary package
from a local <samp><span class="file">zip</span></samp> file by setting argument <code>repos</code> to
<code>NULL</code>.   <code>Rgui.exe</code> has a menu <code>Packages</code> with a GUI
interface to <code>install.packages</code>, <code>update.packages</code> and
<code>library</code>.

   <p>Windows binary packages for R are nowadays distributed as a single
binary containing either or both architectures (R 2.11.x had separate
repository areas for 32- and 64-bit binary packages).

   <p>A few of the binary packages need other software to be installed on your
system: see for example
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/2.12/@ReadMe">http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/contrib/2.12/@ReadMe</a>. 
For 64-bit builds, packages using Gtk+ (<strong>Cairo</strong>, <strong>RGtk2</strong>,
<strong>cairoDevice</strong> and those that depend on them) need the <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp>
directory of a bundled distribution from
<a href="http://www.gtk.org/download-windows-64bit.html">http://www.gtk.org/download-windows-64bit.html</a> in the path: note
that this conflicts with the directory of DLLs needed for 32-bit Gtk+ so
you need the correct one first in your path if using both.  One way to
achieve this is to set the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> environment variable in files
<samp><span class="file">R_HOME/etc/i386/Renviron.site</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">R_HOME/etc/x64/Renviron.site</span></samp>.

   <p><samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL</span></samp> works in Windows to install source packages if
you have set up the tools needed (see <a href="#The-Windows-toolset">The Windows toolset</a>). 
<samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL --help</span></samp> will tell you the current options under
Windows (which differ from those on a Unix-alike).

   <p>We have seen occasional permission problems after unpacking source
packages on some Vista/Windows 7/Server 2008 systems: these have been
circumvented by setting the environment variable <samp><span class="env">R_INSTALL_TAR</span></samp> to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tar.exe</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<a name="index-R_005fINSTALL_005fTAR-53"></a>
If you have only a source package that is known to work with current
R and just want a binary Windows build of it, you could make use of
the building service offered at
<a href="http://win-builder.r-project.org/">http://win-builder.r-project.org/</a>.

   <p>For almost all packages <samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL</span></samp> will attempt to install
both 32- and 64-bit builds of a package if run from a 32/64-bit install
of R on a 64-bit version of Windows.  It will report success if the
installation of the architecture of the running <samp><span class="command">R</span></samp> succeeded,
whether or not the other architecture was successfully installed.

   <p>The exceptions are packages with a non-empty <samp><span class="file">configure.win</span></samp> script
or which make use of <samp><span class="file">src/Makefile.win</span></samp>.  If <samp><span class="file">configure.win</span></samp>
does something appropriate to both architectures use<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-8" name="fnd-8"><sup>8</sup></a> option
<samp><span class="option">--force-biarch</span></samp>: otherwise <samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL
--merge-multiarch</span></samp> can be applied to a source tarball to merge separate
32- and 64-bit installs.  (This can only be applied to a tarball, and
will only succeed if both installs succeed.)

   <p>Some notes on porting packages to 64-bit Windows can be found at
<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/Win64/W64porting.html">http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~ripley/Win64/W64porting.html</a>.

<p><a name="Mac-OS-X-packages"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.2 Mac OS X</h4>

<p>On Mac OS X <code>install.packages</code> works as it does on other Unix-alike
systems, but there are additional types <code>mac.binary*</code> (the default
in the <acronym>CRAN</acronym> distribution) that can be passed to
<code>install.packages</code> in order to download and install binary packages
from a suitable repository, and is the default for <acronym>CRAN</acronym> builds
of R.  These Macintosh binary package files have the extension
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">tgz</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The R GUI provides for installation of either binary or
source packages, from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> or local files.

   <p>Originally there was just package type <code>mac.binary</code>, and this was
used for `universal' binaries, that is those designed to run on multiple
CPU types (PowerPC and i386 at the time).  Later it became necessary to
use different binary distributions for different versions of Mac OS X,
and we now have <code>mac.binary.universal</code> (for Mac OS 10.4 aka
`Tiger', last built for R 2.10.1) and <code>mac.binary.leopard</code> (for
Mac OS 10.5 and 10.6).

<p><a name="Customizing-package-compilation"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.3 Customizing package compilation</h4>

<p>The R system and package-specific compilation flags can be overridden or
added to by setting the appropriate Make variables in the personal file
<samp><var>HOME</var><span class="file">/.R/Makevars-</span><var>R_PLATFORM</var></samp> (but
<samp><var>HOME</var><span class="file">/.R/Makevars.win</span></samp> or <samp><var>HOME</var><span class="file">/.R/Makevars.win64</span></samp>
on Windows), or if that does not exist, <samp><var>HOME</var><span class="file">/.R/Makevars</span></samp>,
where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R_PLATFORM</span></samp>&rsquo; is the platform for which R was built, as
available in the <code>platform</code> component of the R variable
<code>R.version</code>.

   <p>Package developers are encouraged to use this mechanism to enable a
reasonable amount of diagnostic messaging (&ldquo;warnings&rdquo;) when compiling,
such as e.g. <samp><span class="option">-Wall -pedantic</span></samp> for tools from GCC, the Gnu
Compiler Collection.

   <p>Note that this mechanism can also be used when it necessary to change
the optimization level for a particular package.  For example

<pre class="example">     ## <span class="roman">for C code</span>
     CFLAGS=-g -O
     ## <span class="roman">for C++ code</span>
     CXXFLAGS=-g -O
     ## <span class="roman">for Fortran code</span>
     FFLAGS=-g -O
     ## <span class="roman">for Fortran 95 code</span>
     FCFLAGS=-g -O
</pre>
   <p>As from R 2.12.0 there is also provision for a site-wide
<samp><span class="file">Makevars.site</span></samp> file under <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/etc</span></samp> (in a
sub-architecture-specific directory if appropriate).  This is read
immediately after <samp><span class="file">Makeconf</span></samp>.

<p><a name="Multiple-sub-architectures"></a>
<a name="Multiple-sub_002darchitectures"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">6.3.4 Multiple sub-architectures</h4>

<p>When installing packages from their sources, there are some extra
considerations on installations which use sub-architectures.  These are
commonly used on Mac OS X and (from R 2.12.0) on Windows, but can in
principle be used on other platforms.

   <p>When a source package is installed by a build of R which supports
multiple sub-architectures, the normal installation process installs the
packages for all sub-architectures, but only tests it can be loaded
under the current sub-architecture.  The exceptions are

     <dl>
<dt><em>Unix-alikes</em><dd>
where there is an <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> script, or a file <samp><span class="file">src/Makefile</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><em>Windows</em><dd>
where there is a non-empty <samp><span class="file">configure.win</span></samp> script, or a file
<samp><span class="file">src/Makefile.win</span></samp> (with some exceptions where the package is known
to have an architecture-independent <samp><span class="file">configure.win</span></samp>, or if
<samp><span class="option">--force-biarch</span></samp> is used to assert so).

   </dl>

<p class="noindent">In those cases only the current architecture is installed.  Further
sub-architectures can be installed by

<pre class="example">     R CMD INSTALL --libs-only <var>pkg</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">using the path to <samp><span class="command">R</span></samp> or <samp><span class="command">R --arch</span></samp> to select the
additional sub-architecture.  On Windows there is also <samp><span class="command">R CMD
INSTALL --merge-multiarch</span></samp> to build and merge the two architectures.

<p><a name="Updating-packages"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.4 Updating packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-update_002epackages-54"></a><a name="index-Packages_002c-updating-55"></a>
The command <code>update.packages()</code> is the simplest way to ensure that
all the packages on your system are up to date.  Set the <code>repos</code>
argument as in the previous section.  The <code>update.packages()</code>
downloads the list of available packages and their current versions,
compares it with those installed and offers to fetch and install any
that have later versions on the repositories.

   <p>An alternative interface to keeping packages up-to-date is provided by
the command <code>packageStatus()</code>, which returns an object with
information on all installed packages and packages available at multiple
repositories.  The <code>print</code> and <code>summary</code> methods give an
overview of installed and available packages, the <code>upgrade</code> method
offers to fetch and install the latest versions of outdated packages.

   <p>One sometimes-useful additional piece of information that
<code>packageStatus()</code> returns is the status of a package, as
<code>"ok"</code>, <code>"upgrade"</code> or <code>"unavailable"</code> (in the currently
selected repositories).  For example

<pre class="example">     &gt; inst &lt;- packageStatus()$inst
     &gt; with(inst, inst[Status != "ok", c(1, 3, 14)])
                       Package Version      Status
     Biobase           Biobase   2.8.0 unavailable
     RCurl               RCurl   1.4-2     upgrade
     Rgraphviz       Rgraphviz  1.26.0 unavailable
     rgdal               rgdal  0.6-27     upgrade
</pre>
   <p><a name="Removing-packages"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.5 Removing packages</h3>

<p><a name="index-remove_002epackages-56"></a><a name="index-Packages_002c-removing-57"></a>
Packages can be removed in a number of ways.  From a command prompt they
can be removed by

<pre class="example">     R CMD REMOVE -l /path/to/library <var>pkg1</var> <var>pkg2</var> ...
</pre>
   <p>From a running R process they can be removed by

<pre class="example">     &gt; remove.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2"),
                       lib = file.path("path", "to", "library"))
</pre>
   <p>Finally, in most installations one can just remove the package directory
from the library.

<p><a name="Setting-up-a-package-repository"></a>

<h3 class="section">6.6 Setting up a package repository</h3>

<p><a name="index-Repositories-58"></a>
Utilities such as <code>install.packages</code> can be pointed at any
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>-style repository, and R users may want to set up their
own.  The `base' of a repository is a URL such as
<a href="http://www.omegahat.org/R/">http://www.omegahat.org/R/</a>: this must be an URL scheme that
<code>download.packages</code> supports (which also includes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ftp://</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">file://</span></samp>&rsquo;).  Under that base URL there should be directory trees
for one or more of the following types of package distributions:

     <ul>
<li><code>"source"</code>: located at <samp><span class="file">src/contrib</span></samp> and containing
<samp><span class="file">.tar.gz</span></samp> files.  As from R 2.10.0 other forms of compression
can be used, e.g. <samp><span class="file">.tar.bz2</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">.tar.xz</span></samp> files.

<h3 class="section">6.7 Checking installed source packages</h3>

<p>It can be convenient to run <samp><span class="command">R CMD check</span></samp> on an installed
package, particularly on a platform which uses sub-architectures.  The
outline of how to do this is, with the source package in directory
<samp><var>pkgname</var></samp> (or a tarball filename):

<pre class="example">     R CMD INSTALL -l <var>libdir</var> <var>pkgname</var> &gt; <var>pkgname</var>.log 2&gt;&amp;1
     R CMD check -l <var>libdir</var> --install=check:<var>pkgname</var>.log <var>pkgname</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Where sub-architectures are in use the <samp><span class="command">R CMD check</span></samp> line can be
repeated with additional architectures by

<pre class="example">     R --arch <var>arch</var> CMD check -l <var>libdir</var> --extra-arch --install=check:<var>pkgname</var>.log <var>pkgname</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <samp><span class="option">--extra-arch</span></samp> selects only those checks which depend on
the installed code and not those which analyse the sources.  (If
multiple sub-architectures fail only because they need different
settings, e.g. environment variables, <samp><span class="option">--no-multiarch</span></samp> may need
to be added to the <code>INSTALL</code> lines.)  On Mac OS X and other
Unix-alikes the architecture to run is selected by <samp><span class="option">--arch</span></samp>: this
can also be used on Windows with <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/bin/R.exe</span></samp>, but it
is more usual to select the path to the <samp><span class="command">Rcmd.exe</span></samp> of the
desired architecture.

   <p>So on Windows to install, check and package for distribution a source
package from a tarball which has been tested on another platform one
might use

<pre class="example">     .../bin/i386/Rcmd INSTALL -l <var>libdir</var> <var>tarball</var> --build &gt; <var>pkgname</var>.log 2&gt;&amp;1
     .../bin/i386/Rcmd check -l <var>libdir</var> --extra-arch --install=check:<var>pkgname</var>.log <var>pkgname</var>
     .../bin/x64/Rcmd check -l <var>libdir</var> --extra-arch --install=check:<var>pkgname</var>.log <var>pkgname</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where one might want to run the second and third lines in a different
shell with different settings for environment variables and the path (to
find external software, notably for Gtk+).

   <p><samp><span class="command">R CMD INSTALL</span></samp> can do a <code>i386</code> install and then add the
<code>x64</code> DLL by

<pre class="example">     R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch -l <var>libdir</var> <var>tarball</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and <samp><span class="option">--build</span></samp> can be added to zip up the installation.

<p><a name="Internationalization"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">7 Internationalization and Localization</h2>

<p><a name="index-Internationalization-59"></a><a name="index-Localization-60"></a>
<em>Internationalization</em> refers to the process of enabling support
for many human languages, and <em>localization</em> to adapting to a
specific country and language.

   <p>Historically R worked in the ISO Latin-1 8-bit character set and so
covered English and most Western European languages (if not necessarily
their currency symbols).  Since R 2.1.0 it has supported (optionally
before R 2.10.0) multi-byte character sets such as UTF-8 and others
used for Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

   <p>Current builds of R support all the character sets that the
underlying OS can handle.  These are interpreted according to the
<a name="index-Locale-61"></a>current <code>locale</code>, a sufficiently complicated topic to merit a
separate section.  Note though that R has no built-in support for
right-to-left languages and bidirectional output, relying on the OS
services.  For example, how character vectors in UTF-8 containing both
English digits and Hebrew characters are printed is OS-dependent (and
perhaps locale-dependent).

   <p>The other aspect of the internationalization is support for the
translation of messages.  This is enabled in almost all builds of R.

<p><a name="Locales"></a>

<h3 class="section">7.1 Locales</h3>

<p><a name="index-Locale-62"></a>
A <em>locale</em> is a description of the local environment of the user,
including the preferred language, the encoding of characters, the
currency used and its conventions, and so on.  Aspects of the locale are
accessed by the R functions <code>Sys.getlocale</code> and
<code>Sys.localeconv</code>.

   <p>The system of naming locales is OS-specific.  There is quite wide
agreement on schemes, but not on the details of their implementation.  A
locale needs to specify
     <ul>
<li>A human language.  These are generally specified by a lower-case
two-character abbreviation following ISO 639 (see e.g. 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1</a>).

     <li>A `territory', used mainly to specify the currency. These are generally
specified by an upper-case two-character abbreviation following ISO 3166
(see e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166</a>).  Sometimes
the combination of language and territory is used to specify the
encoding, for example to distinguish between traditional and simplified
Chinese.

     <li>A charset encoding, which determines both how a byte stream should be
divided into characters, and which characters the subsequences of bytes
represent.

     <li>Optionally, a modifier, for example to indicate that Austria is to be
considered pre- or post-Euro. 
</ul>

   <p>R is principally concerned with the first (for translations) and
third.  Note that the charset may be deducible from the language, as
some OSes offer only one charset per language, and most OSes have only
one charset each for many languages.  Note too the remark above about
Chinese.

<p><a name="Locales-under-Linux"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">7.1.1 Locales under Linux</h4>

<p>Modern Linux uses the XPG<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-9" name="fnd-9"><sup>9</sup></a> locale specifications which have the form
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB.UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">aa_ER.UTF-8@saaho</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">de_AT.iso885915@euro</span></samp>&rsquo;, the components being in the order listed
above.  (See <samp><span class="command">man locale</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">locale -a</span></samp> for more
details.)  Similar schemes are used by most Unix-alikes: some (including
some distributions of Linux) use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.utf8</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<p><a name="Locales-under-Windows"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">7.1.2 Locales under Windows</h4>

<p>Windows also uses locales, but specified in a rather less concise way. 
Most users will encounter locales only via drop-down menus, but more
information and lists can be found at
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/html/_crt_language_and_country_strings.asp">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/html/_crt_language_and_country_strings.asp</a>.

   <p>It offers only one encoding per language.

   <p>Some care is needed with Windows' locale names.  For example,
<code>chinese</code> is Traditional Chinese and not Simplified Chinese as used
in most of the Chinese-speaking world.

<p><a name="Locales-under-Mac-OS-X"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">7.1.3 Locales under Mac OS X</h4>

<p>Mac OS X supports locales in its own particular way, but the R GUI tries
to make this easier for users. See
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/">http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/</a>
for how users can set their locales.  As with Windows, end users will
generally only see lists of languages/territories.  Users of R in a
terminal may need to set the locale to something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB.UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo;
if it defaults to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Internally Mac OS X uses a form similar to Linux but without specifying
the encoding (which is normally <code>UTF-8</code>).  It is based on ICU
locales IDs (<a href="http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale">http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale</a>) and not
XPG ones, but utilities such as <code>Sys.setlocale()</code> do now normally
accept XPG forms.

<p><a name="Localization-of-messages"></a>

<h3 class="section">7.2 Localization of messages</h3>

<p>The preferred language for messages is by default taken from the locale. 
This can be overridden first by the setting of the environment variable
<a name="index-LANGUAGE-63"></a><a name="index-LC_005fALL-64"></a><a name="index-LC_005fMESSAGES-65"></a><a name="index-LANG-66"></a><samp><span class="env">LANGUAGE</span></samp> and then<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-10" name="fnd-10"><sup>10</sup></a>
by the environment variables <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">LC_MESSAGES</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp>. (The last three are normally used to set the locale and so
should not be needed, but the first is only used to select the language
for messages.)  The code tries hard to map locales to languages, but on
some systems (notably Windows) the locale names needed for the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">LC_ALL</span></samp> do not all correspond to XPG language
names and so <samp><span class="env">LANGUAGE</span></samp> may need to be set.  (One example is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LC_ALL=es</span></samp>&rsquo; on Windows which sets the locale to Estonian and the
language to Spanish.)

   <p>It is usually possible to change the language once R is running
<em>via</em> (not Windows) <code>Sys.setlocale("LC_MESSAGES",
"new_locale")</code>, or by setting an environment variable such as
<samp><span class="env">LANGUAGE</span></samp>, <em>provided</em><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-11" name="fnd-11"><sup>11</sup></a> the language you are changing to can be output in the current
character set.

   <p>Messages are divided into <em>domains</em>, and translations may be
available for some or all messages in a domain.  R makes use of the
following domains.

     <ul>
<li>Domain <code>R</code> for basic C-level error messages.

     <li>Domain <code>R-</code><var>pkg</var> for the R <code>stop</code>, <code>warning</code> and
<code>message</code> messages in each package, including <code>R-base</code> for the
<strong>base</strong> package.

     <li>Domain <var>pkg</var> for the C-level messages in each package.

     <li>Domain <code>RGui</code> for the menus etc of the R for Windows GUI front-end.

   </ul>

   <p>Dividing up the messages in this way allows R to be extensible: as
packages are loaded, their message translation catalogues can be loaded
too.

   <p>Translations are looked for by domain according to the currently
specified language, as specifically as possible, so for example an
Austrian (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">de_AT</span></samp>&rsquo;) translation catalogue will be used in preference
to a generic German one (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">de</span></samp>&rsquo;) for an Austrian user.  However, if a
specific translation catalogue exists but does not contain a
translation, the less specific catalogues are consulted.  For example,
R has catalogues for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB</span></samp>&rsquo; that translate the Americanisms
(e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gray</span></samp>&rsquo;) in the standard messages into English.  Two other
examples: there are catalogues for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">es</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is Spanish as
written in Spain and these will by default also be used in
Spanish-speaking Latin American countries, and also for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pt_BR</span></samp>&rsquo;,
which are used for Brazilian locales but not for locales specifying
Portugal.

   <p>Translations in the right language but the wrong charset be made use of
<a name="index-LANGUAGE-67"></a>by on-the-fly re-encoding.  The <samp><span class="env">LANGUAGE</span></samp> variable (only) can be a
colon-separated list, for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">se:de</span></samp>&rsquo;, giving a set of
languages in decreasing order of preference.  One special value is
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en@quot</span></samp>&rsquo;, which can be used in a UTF-8 locale to have American
error messages with pairs of quotes translated to Unicode directional
quotes.

   <p>If no suitable translation catalogue is found or a particular message is
not translated in any suitable catalogue, `English'<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-12" name="fnd-12"><sup>12</sup></a> is used.

   <p>See <a href="http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html">http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html</a> for how to
prepare and install translation catalogues.

<a name="Choosing-between-32_002d-and-64_002dbit-builds"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">8 Choosing between 32- and 64-bit builds</h2>

<p>Many current <acronym>CPU</acronym>s have both 32- and 64-bit sets of
instructions: this has long been true for UltraSparc and more recently
for MIPS, PPC and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; (sometimes known as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">amd64</span></samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Intel64</span></samp>&rsquo;: all but a few low-power current &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo;
CPUs support this chipset).  Many OSes running on such <acronym>CPU</acronym>s
offer the choice of building a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of R (and
details are given below under specific OSes).  For most a 32-bit version
is the default, but for some (e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux and Mac OS
10.6) 64-bit is.

   <p>All current versions of R use 32-bit integers and
<acronym>IEC</acronym>&nbsp;60559<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-13" name="fnd-13"><sup>13</sup></a> double-precision reals, and so compute to
the same precision<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-14" name="fnd-14"><sup>14</sup></a> and with the same limits on the sizes of
numerical quantities.  The principal difference is in the size of the
pointers.

   <p>64-bit builds have both advantages and disadvantages:
     <ul>
<li>The total virtual memory space made available to a 32-bit process is
limited by the pointer size to 4GB, and on most OSes to 3GB (or even
2GB).  The limits for 64-bit processes are much larger (e.g. 
8&ndash;128TB).

     <p>R allocates memory for large objects as needed, and removes any
unused ones at garbage collection.  When the sizes of objects become an
appreciable fraction of the address limit, fragmentation of the address
space becomes an issue and there may be no hole available that is the
size requested.  This can cause more frequent garbage collection or the
inability to allocate large objects.  As a guide, this will become an
issue with objects more than 10% of the size of the address space
(around 300Mb) or when the total size of objects in use is around one
third (around 1Gb).

     <li>32-bit OSes by default limit file sizes to 2GB (and this may also apply
to 32-bit builds on 64-bit OSes).  This can often be worked around: and
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> selects suitable defines if this is possible.  (We
have also largely worked around that limit on 32-bit Windows.)  64-bit
builds have much larger limits.

     <li>Because the pointers are larger, R's basic structures are larger. 
This means that R objects take more space and (usually) more time to
manipulate.  So 64-bit builds of R will, all other things being
equal, run slower than 32-bit builds.  (On Sparc Solaris the difference
was 15-20%.)

     <li>However, `other things' may not be equal.  In the specific case of
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; <em>vs</em> &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo;, the 64-bit CPU has features
(such as SSE2 instructions) which are guaranteed to be present but are
optional on the 32-bit CPU, and also has more general-purpose registers. 
This means that on chips like Intel Core 2 Duo the vanilla 64-bit
version of R is around 10% faster on both Linux and Mac OS X &mdash; this
can be reduced by tuning the compilation to the chip. 
</ul>

   <p>So, for speed you may want to use a 32-bit build, but to handle large
datasets (and perhaps large files) a 64-bit build.  You can often build
both and install them in the same place: See <a href="#Sub_002darchitectures">Sub-architectures</a>.

   <p>Even on 64-bit builds of R there are limits on the size of R
objects (see <code>help("Memory-limits")</code>, some of which stem from the
use of 32-bit integers (especially in FORTRAN code).  On all builds of
R, the maximum length (number of elements) of a vector is
2^31-1, about 2 billion, and on 64-bit builds the size of a
block of memory allocated is limited to 2^34-1 bytes (8GB).  It
is anticipated these will be raised eventually but routine use of 8GB
objects is (when this was written in 2005) several years off.

<p><a name="The-standalone-Rmath-library"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">9 The standalone Rmath library</h2>

<p>The routines supporting the distribution and
special<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-15" name="fnd-15"><sup>15</sup></a> functions in R
and a few others are declared in C header file <samp><span class="file">Rmath.h</span></samp>.  These
can be compiled into a standalone library for linking to other
applications.  (Note that they are not a separate library when R is
built, and the standalone version differs in several ways.)

   <p>The makefiles and other sources needed are in directory
<samp><span class="file">src/nmath/standalone</span></samp>, so the following instructions assume that
is the current working directory (in the build directory tree on a
Unix-alike if that is separate from the sources).

   <p><samp><span class="file">Rmath.h</span></samp> contains &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R_VERSION_STRING</span></samp>&rsquo;, which is a character
string containing the current R version, for example <code>"2.11.0"</code>.

   <p>There is full access to R's handling of <code>NaN</code>s, <code>Inf</code> and
<code>-Inf</code> via special versions of the macros and functions

<pre class="example">         ISNAN, R_FINITE, R_log, R_pow and R_pow_di
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and (extern) constants <code>R_PosInf</code>, <code>R_NegInf</code> and <code>NA_REAL</code>.

   <p>There is no support for R's notion of missing values, in particular
not for <code>NA_INTEGER</code> nor the distinction between <code>NA</code> and
<code>NaN</code> for doubles.

   <p>A little care is needed to use the random-number routines. You will
need to supply the uniform random number generator

<pre class="example">         double unif_rand(void)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or use the one supplied (and with a shared library or DLL you will
have to use the one supplied, which is the Marsaglia-multicarry with
an entry point

<pre class="example">         set_seed(unsigned int, unsigned int)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to set its seeds).

   <p>The facilities to change the normal random number generator are
available through the constant N01_kind. This takes values
from the enumeration type

<pre class="example">     typedef enum {
         BUGGY_KINDERMAN_RAMAGE,
         AHRENS_DIETER,
         BOX_MULLER,
         USER_NORM,
         INVERSION,
         KINDERMAN_RAMAGE
     } N01type;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">USER_NORM</span></samp>&rsquo; is not available).

<h3 class="section">9.1 Unix-alikes</h3>

<p>If R has not already be made in the directory tree,
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> must be run as described in the main build
instructions.

   <p>Then

<pre class="example">     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will make standalone libraries <samp><span class="file">libRmath.a</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">libRmath.so</span></samp>:
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make static</span></samp>&rsquo; and <code>make shared</code> will create just one of them.

   <p><strong>NB:</strong> certain compilers are unable to do compile-time IEEE-754
arithmetic and so cannot compile <samp><span class="file">mlutils.c</span></samp> and several other
files.  The known example is old versions of Sun's <code>cc</code> (e.g. 
Forte 6 and 7).

   <p>To use the routines in your own C or C++ programs, include

<pre class="example">     #define MATHLIB_STANDALONE
     #include &lt;Rmath.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and link against &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lRmath</span></samp>&rsquo; (and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lm</span></samp>&rsquo; if needed on your OS). 
The example file <samp><span class="file">test.c</span></samp> does nothing useful, but is provided to
test the process (via <samp><span class="command">make test</span></samp>).  Note that you will probably
not be able to run it unless you add the directory containing
<a name="index-LD_005fLIBRARY_005fPATH-68"></a><samp><span class="file">libRmath.so</span></samp> to the <samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> environment variable.

   <p>The targets

<pre class="example">     make install
     make uninstall
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will (un)install the header <samp><span class="file">Rmath.h</span></samp> and shared and static
<a name="index-DESTDIR-69"></a>libraries (if built).  Both <code>prefix=</code> and <samp><span class="env">DESTDIR</span></samp> are
supported, together with more precise control as described for the main

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">make install</span></samp>&rsquo; installs a file for <samp><span class="command">pkg-config</span></samp> to use by

<p><a name="Windows-standalone"></a>

<h3 class="section">9.2 Windows</h3>

<p>You need to set up almost all the tools to make R and then run (in a
Unix-like shell)

<pre class="example">     (cd ../../include; make -f Makefile.win config.h Rconfig.h Rmath.h)
     make -f Makefile.win

</pre>
   <p>This creates a static library <samp><span class="file">libRmath.a</span></samp> and a DLL
<samp><span class="file">Rmath.dll</span></samp>.  If you want an import library <samp><span class="file">libRmath.dll.a</span></samp>
(you don't need one), use

</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and link against &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lRmath</span></samp>&rsquo;.  This will use the first found of
<samp><span class="file">libRmath.dll.a</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">libRmath.a</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">Rmath.dll</span></samp> in that
order, so the result depends on which files are present.  You should be
able to force static or dynamic linking  <em>via</em>

<pre class="example">     -Wl,-Bstatic -lRmath -Wl,dynamic
     -Wl,-Bdynamic -lRmath
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or by linking to explicit files (as in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">test</span></samp>&rsquo; target in
<samp><span class="file">Makefile.win</span></samp>: this makes two executables, <samp><span class="file">test.exe</span></samp> which
is dynamically linked, and <samp><span class="file">test-static.exe</span></samp>, which is statically
linked).

   <p>It is possible to link to <samp><span class="file">Rmath.dll</span></samp> using other compilers, either
directly or via an import library: if you make a MinGW import library as
above, you will create a file <samp><span class="file">Rmath.def</span></samp> which can be used
(possibly after editing) to create an import library for other systems
such as Visual C++.

   <p>If you make use of dynamic linking you should use

<pre class="example">     #define MATHLIB_STANDALONE
     #define RMATH_DLL
     #include &lt;Rmath.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to ensure that the constants like <code>NA_REAL</code> are linked correctly. 
(Auto-import will probably work with MinGW, but it is better to be
sure. This is likely to also work with VC++, Borland and similar
compilers.)

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Essential and useful other programs under a Unix-alike</h2>

<p>This appendix gives details of programs you will need to build R on
Unix-like platforms, or which will be used by R if found by
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.

   <p>Remember that some package management systems (such as <acronym>RPM</acronym> and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
development version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-devel</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-dev</span></samp>&rsquo;: you need both versions
installed.

<p><a name="Essential-programs-and-libraries"></a>

<h3 class="section">A.1 Essential programs and libraries</h3>

<p>You need a means of compiling C and FORTRAN 77 (see <a href="#Using-FORTRAN">Using FORTRAN</a>).  Some add-on packages also need a C++ compiler.  Your C
compiler should be <acronym>IEC</acronym>&nbsp;60059<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-16" name="fnd-16"><sup>16</sup></a>, POSIX 1003.1 and C99-compliant.  R tries to
choose suitable flags for the C compilers it knows about, but you may
have to set <code>CC</code> or <code>CFLAGS</code> suitably.  For recent versions of
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> with <code>glibc</code> this means including
<samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-17" name="fnd-17"><sup>17</sup></a>.  If the compiler is
detected as <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, <samp><span class="option">-std=gnu99</span></samp> will be appended to
<code>CC</code> unless it conflicts with a setting of <code>CFLAGS</code>.  (Note
that options essential to run the compiler even for linking, such as
those to set the architecture, should be specified as part of <code>CC</code>
rather than of <code>CFLAGS</code>.)

   <p>Unless you do not want to view graphs on-screen you need &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X11</span></samp>&rsquo;
installed, including its headers and client libraries.  (You also need
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X11</span></samp>&rsquo; installed to use the <code>jpeg()</code>, <code>png()</code>,
<code>tiff()</code> and <code>bmp()</code> devices.)  For recent Fedora
distributions it means (at least) &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libX11</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libX11-devel</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libXt</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libXt-devel</span></samp>&rsquo;.  On Debian we recommend the
meta-package &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xorg-dev</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If you really do not want these you will
need to explicitly configure R without X11, using
<samp><span class="option">--with-x=no</span></samp>.

   <p>The command-line editing (and command completion) depends on the
<code>readline</code> library available from any <acronym>GNU</acronym> mirror: version
4.2 or later is needed for all the features to be enabled.  Otherwise
you will need to configure with <samp><span class="option">--with-readline=no</span></samp> (or
equivalent).

   <p>A suitably comprehensive <code>iconv</code> function is essential.  The R
usage requires <code>iconv</code> to be able to translate between
<code>"latin1"</code> and <code>"UTF-8"</code>, to recognize <code>""</code> as the
current encoding and <code>"ASCII"</code>, and to translate to and from the
Unicode wide-character formats <code>"UCS-[24][BL]E"</code> &mdash; this is true
for <code>glibc</code> but not of most commercial Unixes.  However, you can
make use of <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>libiconv</code> (possibly as a plug-in
replacement: see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/</a>).

   <p>The OS needs to have enough support<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-18" name="fnd-18"><sup>18</sup></a> for wide-character
types: this is checked at configuration.

   <p>A <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> program is needed to unpack the sources and packages
(including the recommended packages).  A version<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-19" name="fnd-19"><sup>19</sup></a> that can
automagically detect compressed archives is preferred for use with
<code>untar()</code>: the configure script looks for <samp><span class="command">gtar</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="command">gnutar</span></samp> before
<a name="index-TAR-70"></a><samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp>: use environment variable <samp><span class="env">TAR</span></samp> to override this.

   <p>There need to be suitable versions of the tools <samp><span class="command">grep</span></samp>,
<samp><span class="command">sed</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">tr</span></samp>: the problems are usually with old AT&amp;T
and BSD variants.  <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> will try to find suitable
versions (including looking in <samp><span class="file">/usr/xpg4/bin</span></samp> which is used on
some commercial Unixes).

   <p>You will not be able to build most of the manuals unless you have
<samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> version 4.7 or later installed, and if not some of
the <acronym>HTML</acronym> manuals will be linked to <acronym>CRAN</acronym>. To make DVI or PDF
versions of the manuals you will also need file <samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp>
installed (which is part of the <acronym>GNU</acronym> <strong>texinfo</strong> distribution
but is often made part of the TeX package in re-distributions) as
well as <samp><span class="command">texi2dvi</span></samp>.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-20" name="fnd-20"><sup>20</sup></a>  Further, the versions of <samp><span class="command">texi2dvi</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">texinfo.tex</span></samp> need to be compatible: we have seen problems with
older TeX distributions (TeXLive 2007 and MiKTeX 2.8) used with
<strong>texinfo</strong> 4.13.

   <p><a name="index-Vignettes-71"></a>The DVI and PDF documentation and building vignettes needs <samp><span class="command">tex</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="command">latex</span></samp>, or <samp><span class="command">pdftex</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">pdflatex</span></samp>.  As
from R 2.11.0 we require LaTeX version <code>2005/12/01</code> or later
(for UTF-8 support).  Building PDF package manuals (including the R
reference manual) and vignettes is sensitive to the version of the
LaTeX package <strong>hyperref</strong> and we recommend that the TeX
distribution used is keep up-to-date.  A number of LaTeX packages are
required (including <strong>url</strong>) and others such as <strong>hyperref</strong> are
desirable.

   <p>If you want to build from the R Subversion repository you need both
<samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">pdflatex</span></samp>. 
<a name="index-Subversion-72"></a>
<a name="index-PATH-73"></a>The essential programs should be in your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> at the time
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> is run: this will capture the full paths.

<p><a name="Useful-libraries-and-programs"></a>

<h3 class="section">A.2 Useful libraries and programs</h3>

<p>The ability to use translated messages makes use of <code>gettext</code> and
most likely needs <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>gettext</code>: you do need this to work
with new translations, but otherwise the version contained in the R
sources will be used if no suitable external <code>gettext</code> is found.

   <p>The `modern' version of the <code>X11</code>, <code>jpeg()</code>, <code>png()</code> and
<code>tiff()</code> graphics devices uses the <code>cairo</code> and (optionally)
<code>Pango</code> libraries.  Cairo version 1.2.0 or later is required. 
Pango needs to be at least version 1.10, and 1.12 is the earliest
version we have tested.  (For Fedora users we believe the
<code>pango-devel</code> RPM and its dependencies suffice.)  R checks for
<samp><span class="command">pkg-config</span></samp>, and uses that to check first that the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">pangocairo</span></samp>&rsquo; package is installed (and if not, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cairo</span></samp>&rsquo;) and if
additional flags are needed for the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cairo-xlib</span></samp>&rsquo; package, then if
suitable code can be compiled.  These tests will fail if
<samp><span class="command">pkg-config</span></samp> is not installed, and are likely to fail if
<code>cairo</code> was built statically (unusual).  Most systems with
<code>Gtk+</code> 2.8 or later installed will have suitable libraries.  Mac OS
X comes with none of these libraries, but <code>cairo</code> support (without
<code>Pango</code>) has been added to the binary distribution:
<code>pkg-config</code> is still needed and can be installed from the sources.

   <p>For the best font experience with these devices you need suitable fonts
installed: Linux users will want the <code>urw-fonts</code> package.  Another
useful set of fonts is the `liberation' truetype fonts available at
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/promo/fonts/">https://www.redhat.com/promo/fonts/</a>,<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-21" name="fnd-21"><sup>21</sup></a> which cover the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets
plus a fair range of signs.  These share metrics with Arial, Times New
Roman and Courier New, and contain fonts rather similar to the first two
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts</a>).

   <p>The bitmapped graphics devices <code>jpeg()</code>, <code>png()</code> and
<code>tiff()</code> need the appropriate headers and libraries installed:
<code>jpeg</code> (version 6b or later, or <code>libjpeg-turbo</code>) or
<code>libpng</code> (version 1.2.7 or later, including 1.4.x and 1.5.x) and
<code>zlib</code> or <code>libtiff</code> (any recent version of 3.x.y &ndash; 3.8.2 and
3.9.[124] have been tested) respectively.

   <p>If you have them installed (including the appropriate headers and of
suitable versions), <code>zlib</code>, <code>libbz2</code> and PCRE will be used if
specified by <samp><span class="option">--with-system-zlib</span></samp> (version 1.2.3 or later, but
beware that bugs have been found with 1.2.4 and 1.2.5, and these should
not be used on 32-bit Linux systems with LFS),
<samp><span class="option">--with-system-bzlib</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--with-system-pcre</span></samp>: otherwise
versions in the R sources will be compiled in.  As the latter suffice
and are tested with R you should not need to change this.

   <p><code>liblzma</code> from <code>xz-utils</code> version 4.999 or later (preferably
5.0.0 or later) will be used if installed: the version in the R
sources can be selected instead by configuring with
<samp><span class="option">--with-system-xz=no</span></samp>.

   <p>Use of the X11 clipboard selection requires the <code>Xmu</code> headers and
libraries.  These are normally part of an X11 installation (e.g. the
Debian meta-package &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xorg-dev</span></samp>&rsquo;), but some distributions have split
this into smaller parts, so for example recent versions of Fedora
require the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libXmu</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">libXmu-devel</span></samp>&rsquo; RPMs.

   <p>Some systems (notably Mac OS X and at least some FreeBSD systems) have
inadequate support for collation in multibyte locales.  It is possible
to replace the OS's collation support by that from ICU (International
Components for Unicode, <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/">http://site.icu-project.org/</a>), and this
provides much more precise control over collation on all systems.  ICU
is available as sources and as binary distributions for (at least) most
Linux distributions, Solaris 9/10, AIX and Windows, usually as
<code>libicu</code> or <code>icu4c</code>.  It will be used by default where
available (including on Mac OS X &gt;= 10.4): should a broken version of
ICU be found this can be suppressed by <samp><span class="option">--without-ICU</span></samp>.

   <p>A few code developers may want Perl version 5.8.0 or later, available via
<a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/</a>.  This is needed for the rarely used
<samp><span class="command">R CMD Sd2Rd</span></samp>: if required it should be in your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> when
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> is run.

<!-- The Perl scripts left are -->
<!-- src/scripts: Sd2Rd -->
<!-- tools: help2man.pl install-info.pl -->
   <p>The <code>bitmap</code> and <code>dev2bitmap</code> devices and also
<code>embedFonts()</code> use ghostscript
(<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost">http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost</a>).  This should either be in your
path when the command is run, or its full path specified by the
environment variable <samp><span class="env">R_GSCMD</span></samp> at that time. 
<a name="index-R_005fGSCMD-74"></a>

<p><a name="Tcl%2fTk"></a>
<a name="Tcl_002fTk"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">A.2.1 Tcl/Tk</h4>

<p>The <strong>tcltk</strong> package needs Tcl/Tk &gt;= 8.4 installed: the sources are
available at <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">http://www.tcl.tk/</a>.  To specify the locations of the
Tcl/Tk files you may need the configuration options

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--with-tcltk</span></samp><dd>use Tcl/Tk, or specify its library directory
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--with-tcl-config=</span><var>TCL_CONFIG</var></samp><dd>specify location of <samp><span class="file">tclConfig.sh</span></samp>
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--with-tk-config=</span><var>TK_CONFIG</var></samp><dd>specify location of <samp><span class="file">tkConfig.sh</span></samp>
</dl>

<p class="noindent">or use the configure variables <code>TCLTK_LIBS</code> and
<code>TCLTK_CPPFLAGS</code> to specify the flags needed for linking against
the Tcl and Tk libraries and for finding the <samp><span class="file">tcl.h</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">tk.h</span></samp> headers, respectively.  If you have both 32- and 64-bit
versions of Tcl/Tk installed, specifying the paths to the correct config
files may be necessary to avoid confusion between them.

   <p>Versions of Tcl/Tk up to 8.5.8 have been tested (including most versions
of 8.4.x, but not recently).

<p><a name="Java-support"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">A.2.2 Java support</h4>

<p><samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> looks for Java support on the host system, and if it
finds it sets some settings which are useful for Java-using packages. 
<a name="index-JAVA_005fHOME-75"></a><samp><span class="env">JAVA_HOME</span></samp> can be set during the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> run to point
to a specific JRE/JDK.

   <p>Principal amongst these are setting some library paths to the Java
libraries and JVM, which are stored in environment variable
<a name="index-R_005fJAVA_005fLD_005fLIBRARY_005fPATH-76"></a><samp><span class="env">R_JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> in file <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/etc/ldpaths</span></samp> (or
a sub-architecture-specific version).  A typical setting for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux is

<pre class="smallexample">     JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0.x86_64/jre
     R_JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${JAVA_HOME}/lib/amd64/server:${JAVA_HOME}/lib/amd64
</pre>
   <p>Note that this unfortunately depends on the exact version of the JRE/JDK
installed, and so may need updating if the Java installation is
updated.  This can be done by running <code>R CMD javareconf</code>. The
script re-runs Java detection in a manner similar to that of the
<code>configure</code> script and updates settings in both <samp><span class="file">Makeconf</span></samp> and
<samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/etc/ldpaths</span></samp>. See <code>R CMD javareconf --help</code> for
details.

   <p>Another alternative of overriding those setting is to  set
<a name="index-R_005fJAVA_005fLD_005fLIBRARY_005fPATH-77"></a><samp><span class="env">R_JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> (e.g. in <samp><span class="file">~/.Renviron</span></samp>), or use
<samp><span class="file">/etc/ld.so.conf</span></samp> to specify the Java runtime library paths to
the system. Other settings are recorded in <samp><span class="file">etc/Makeconf</span></samp> (or a
sub-architecture-specific version), e.g.

<pre class="smallexample">     JAVA = /usr/bin/java
     JAVAC = /usr/bin/javac
     JAVA_HOME = /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06/jre
     JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64/server:$(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64:\
     $(JAVA_HOME)/../lib/amd64:/usr/local/lib64
     JAVA_LIBS = -L$(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64/server -L$(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64
                 -L$(JAVA_HOME)/../lib/amd64 -L/usr/local/lib64 -ljvm
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">JAVA_LIBS</span></samp>&rsquo; contains flags necessary to link JNI programs. 
Some of the above variables can be queried using <code>R CMD config</code>.

<p><a name="Linear-algebra"></a>

<h3 class="section">A.3 Linear algebra</h3>

<p><a name="index-BLAS-library-78"></a>

<p><a name="BLAS"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.1 BLAS</h4>

<p>The linear algebra routines in R can make use of enhanced
<acronym>BLAS</acronym> (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms,
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html">http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html</a>) routines.  However,
these have to be explicitly requested at configure time: R provides
an internal <acronym>BLAS</acronym> which is well-tested and will be adequate for
most uses of R.

   <p>You can specify a particular <acronym>BLAS</acronym> library <em>via</em> a value
for the configuration option <samp><span class="option">--with-blas</span></samp> and not to use an
external <acronym>BLAS</acronym> library by <samp><span class="option">--without-blas</span></samp> (the
default).  If <samp><span class="option">--with-blas</span></samp> is given with no <code>=</code>, its value
is taken from the
<a name="index-BLAS_005fLIBS-79"></a>environment variable <samp><span class="env">BLAS_LIBS</span></samp>, set for example in
<samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp>.  If neither the option nor the environment variable
supply a value, a search is made for a suitable <acronym>BLAS</acronym>.  If the
value is not obviously a linker command (starting with a dash or giving
the path to a library), it is prefixed by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-l</span></samp>&rsquo;, so

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="foo"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is an instruction to link against &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-lfoo</span></samp>&rsquo; to find an external
<acronym>BLAS</acronym> (which needs to be found both at link time and run time).

   <p>The configure code checks that the external <acronym>BLAS</acronym> is complete
(it must include all double precision and double complex
routines<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-22" name="fnd-22"><sup>22</sup></a>, as well as <code>LSAME</code>), and appears to be usable.  However,
an external <acronym>BLAS</acronym> has to be usable from a shared object (so
must contain position-independent code), and that is not checked.

   <p>Some enhanced <acronym>BLAS</acronym>es are compiler-system-specific
(<code>sunperf</code> on Solaris<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-23" name="fnd-23"><sup>23</sup></a>, <code>libessl</code> on IBM,
<code>vecLib</code> on Mac OS X).  The correct incantation for these is
usually found <em>via</em> <samp><span class="option">--with-blas</span></samp> with no value on the
appropriate platforms.

   <p>Some of the external <acronym>BLAS</acronym>es are multi-threaded.  One issue is
that R profiling (which uses the <code>SIGPROF</code> signal) may cause
problems, and you may want to disable profiling if you use a
multi-threaded <acronym>BLAS</acronym>.  Note that using a multi-threaded
<acronym>BLAS</acronym> can result in taking more <acronym>CPU</acronym> time and even
more elapsed time (occasionally dramatically so) than using a similar
single-threaded <acronym>BLAS</acronym>.

   <p>Note that under Unix (but not under Windows) if R is compiled against
a non-default <acronym>BLAS</acronym> and <samp><span class="option">--enable-BLAS-shlib</span></samp> is
<strong>not</strong> used, then all <acronym>BLAS</acronym>-using packages must also be. 
So if R is re-built to use an enhanced <acronym>BLAS</acronym> then packages
such as <strong>quantreg</strong> will need to be re-installed.

   <p>R relies on <acronym>IEC</acronym>&nbsp;60559 compliance of an external
<acronym>BLAS</acronym>.  This can be broken if for example the code assumes that
terms with a zero factor are always zero and do not need to be
computed&mdash;whereas <code>x*0</code> can be <code>NaN</code>.  (The version of the
reference <acronym>BLAS</acronym> used prior to R 2.12.0 did so.)

<p><a name="ATLAS"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">A.3.1.1 ATLAS</h5>

<p>ATLAS (<a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/</a>) is a &ldquo;tuned&rdquo;
<acronym>BLAS</acronym> that runs on a wide range of Unix-alike platforms. 
Unfortunately it is usually built as a static library that on some
platforms cannot be used with shared objects such as are used in R
packages.  Be careful when using pre-built versions of ATLAS (they seem
to work on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo; platforms, but not on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; ones).

   <p>The usual way to specify ATLAS will be via

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lf77blas -latlas"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if the libraries are in the library path, otherwise by

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-L/path/to/ATLAS/libs -lf77blas -latlas"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">For systems with multiple processors it is possible to use a
multi-threaded version of ATLAS, by specifying

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lptf77blas -lpthread -latlas"
</pre>
   <p>Consult its file <samp><span class="file">INSTALL.txt</span></samp> for how to build ATLAS with
position-independent code (at least on version 3.8.0 and later): that
file also describes how to build ATLAS as a shared library.

   <p>ATLAS can also be used on Windows: see see <a href="#Getting-the-source-files">Getting the source files</a>
when building from source, and
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/rw-FAQ.html">R Windows <acronym>FAQ</acronym></a> for adding pre-compiled support to binary versions.

<p><a name="ACML"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">A.3.1.2 ACML</h5>

<!-- : there used to be Solaris 10, but it seems no more. -->
<p>For &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i686</span></samp>&rsquo; processors under Linux there is
the AMD Core Math Library (ACML) <a href="http://www.amd.com/acml">http://www.amd.com/acml</a>.  For
the <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> version we could use

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lacml"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if the appropriate library directory (such as
<a name="index-LD_005fLIBRARY_005fPATH-80"></a><samp><span class="file">/opt/acml4.4.0/gfortran64/lib</span></samp>) is in the <samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp>. 
For other compilers, see the ACML documentation.  There is a
multithreaded Linux version of ACML available for recent versions of
<samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp>.  To make use of this you will need something like

<h5 class="subsubsection">A.3.1.3 Goto BLAS</h5>

<p>Dr Kazushige Goto has written another tuned <acronym>BLAS</acronym> which is
available for several processors and OSes.  The current version is known
as GotoBLAS2, and has (in November 2010) been re-released under a much
less restrictive licence.  Source code can be obtained from
<a href="http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/gotoblas2/">http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/gotoblas2/</a>

   <p>Once it is built and installed, it can be used by configuring R with

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lgoto2"
</pre>
   <p>See see <a href="#Shared-BLAS">Shared BLAS</a> for an alternative (and in many ways preferable)
way to use it.

<p><a name="MKL"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">A.3.1.4 Intel MKL</h5>

<p>svn up
For Intel processors under Linux, there is Intel's Math Kernel Library
(<a href="http://www.intel.com/software/products/mkl/">http://www.intel.com/software/products/mkl/</a>).  You are
strongly encouraged to read the MKL User's Guide, which is installed
with the library, before attempting to link to MKL.

   <p>Version 10 of MKL supports two linking models: the default model, which
is backward compatible with version 9 (see below), and the pure layered
model.  The layered model gives the user fine-grained control over four
different library layers: interface, threading, computation, and
run-time library support. Some examples of linking to MKL using this
layered model are given below. These examples are for GCC compilers on
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The choice of interface layer is important on
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; since the Intel Fortran compiler returns complex values
differently from the <acronym>GNU</acronym> Fortran compiler. You must therefore
use the interface layer that matches your compiler (<code>mkl_intel*</code> or
<code>mkl_gf*</code>).

   <p>R can be linked to a sequential version of MKL by

<pre class="example">     MKL_LIB_PATH=/opt/intel/mkl/10.0.3.020/lib/em64t/
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MKL_LIB_PATH
     MKL="-L${MKL_LIB_PATH} -lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_lapack -lmkl_core"
     ./configure --with-blas="$MKL" --with-lapack
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The order of the libraries is important.  The option
<samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp> is used since MKL contains a copy of LAPACK as
well as <acronym>BLAS</acronym> (see <a href="#LAPACK">LAPACK</a>).

   <p>Threaded MKL may be used by replacing the line defining the variable <code>MKL</code>
with

<pre class="example">     MKL="-L${MKL_LIB_PATH} -lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_gnu_thread \
          -lmkl_lapack -lmkl_core -liomp5 -lpthread"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The default number of threads will be chosen by the OpenMP* software,
but can be controlled by setting <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code> or
<code>MKL_NUM_THREADS</code>.

   <p>Static MKL may be used with

<pre class="example">     MKL="   -L${MKL_LIB_PATH}                               \
             -Wl,--start-group                               \
                     ${MKL_LIB_PATH}/libmkl_gf_lp64.a        \
                     ${MKL_LIB_PATH}/libmkl_gnu_thread.a     \
                     ${MKL_LIB_PATH}/libmkl_core.a           \
             -Wl,--end-group                                 \
             -lgomp -lpthread"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(Thanks to Ei-ji Nakama).

   <p>The default linking model, which is also used by version 9 of MKL, can
be used by

<pre class="example">     --with-blas="-lmkl -lguide -lpthread"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is multi-threaded, but in version 9 the number of threads defaults
to 1.  It can be increased by setting <code>OMP_NUM_THREADS</code>.  (Thanks to
Andy Liaw for the information.)

<p><a name="Shared-BLAS"></a>

<h5 class="subsubsection">A.3.1.5 Shared BLAS</h5>

<p>Note that the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> library will be used for many of the add-on
packages as well as for R itself.  This means that it is better to
use a shared/dynamic <acronym>BLAS</acronym> library, as most of a static library
will be compiled into the R executable and each <acronym>BLAS</acronym>-using
package.

   <p>R offers the option of compiling the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> into a dynamic
library <code>libRblas</code> stored in <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/lib</span></samp> and linking
both R itself and all the add-on packages against that library.

   <p>This is the default on all platforms except AIX unless an external
<acronym>BLAS</acronym> is specified and found: for the latter it can be used by
specifying the option <samp><span class="option">--enable-BLAS-shlib</span></samp>, and it can always be
disabled via <samp><span class="option">--disable-BLAS-shlib</span></samp>.

   <p>This has both advantages and disadvantages.

     <ul>
<li>It saves space by having only a single copy of the <acronym>BLAS</acronym>
routines, which is helpful if there is an external static <acronym>BLAS</acronym>
such as is standard for ATLAS.

     <li>There may be performance disadvantages in using a shared <acronym>BLAS</acronym>. 
Probably the most likely is when R's internal <acronym>BLAS</acronym> is used
and R is <em>not</em> built as a shared library, when it is possible to
build the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> into <samp><span class="file">R.bin</span></samp> (and <samp><span class="file">libR.a</span></samp>) without
using position-independent code.  However, experiments showed that in
many cases using a shared <acronym>BLAS</acronym> was as fast, provided high
levels (e.g., <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>) of compiler optimization are used.

     <li>It is easy to change the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> without needing to re-install
R and all the add-on packages, since all references to the
<acronym>BLAS</acronym> go through <code>libRblas</code>, and that can be replaced. 
Note though that any dynamic libraries the replacement links to will
need to be found by the linker: this may need the library path to be
changed in <samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/etc/ldpaths</span></samp>. 
</ul>

   <p>Another option to change the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> in use is to symlink a
dynamic <acronym>BLAS</acronym> library (such as ACML or Goto's) to
<samp><var>R_HOME</var><span class="file">/lib/libRblas.so</span></samp>.  For example, just

<pre class="example">     mv <var>R_HOME</var>/lib/libRblas.so <var>R_HOME</var>/lib/libRblas.so.keep
     ln -s /opt/acml4.4.0/gfortran64_mp/lib/libacml_mp.so <var>R_HOME</var>/lib/libRblas.so
</pre>
   <p>will change the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> in use to multithreaded ACML.  A similar
link works for recent versions of the Goto <acronym>BLAS</acronym> and perhaps
for MKL (provided the appropriate <samp><span class="file">lib</span></samp> directory is in the
run-time library path or <samp><span class="command">ld.so</span></samp> cache).

<p><a name="LAPACK"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.2 LAPACK</h4>

<p><a name="index-LAPACK-library-81"></a>Provision is made for using an external LAPACK library, principally to
cope with <acronym>BLAS</acronym> libraries which contain a copy of LAPACK (such
as <code>sunperf</code> on Solaris, <code>vecLib</code> on Mac OS X and ACML on
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux).  However, the likely performance
gains are thought to be small (and may be negative), and the default is
not to search for a suitable LAPACK library, and this is definitely
<strong>not</strong> recommended.  You can specify a specific LAPACK library or
a search for a generic library by the configuration option
<samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp>.  The default for <samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp> is to
check the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> library and then look for an external library
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-llapack</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Sites searching for the fastest possible linear
algebra may want to build a LAPACK library using the ATLAS-optimized
subset of LAPACK.  To do so specify something like

<pre class="example">     --with-lapack="-L/path/to/libs -llapack -lcblas"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">since the ATLAS subset of LAPACK depends on <code>libcblas</code>.  A value
for <samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp> can be set <em>via</em> the environment
variable
<a name="index-LAPACK_005fLIBS-82"></a><samp><span class="env">LAPACK_LIBS</span></samp>, but this will only be used if <samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp>
is specified (as the default value is <code>no</code>) and the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> library
does not contain LAPACK.

   <p>Since ACML contains a full LAPACK, if selected as the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> it
can be used as the LAPACK <em>via</em> <samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp>.

   <p>If you do use <samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp>, be aware of potential problems
with bugs in the LAPACK 3.0 sources (or in the posted corrections to those
sources).  In particular, bugs in <code>DGEEV</code> and <code>DGESDD</code> have
resulted in error messages such as

<pre class="example">     DGEBRD gave error code -10
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">.  Other potential problems are incomplete versions of the libraries,
seen several times over the years.  For problems compiling LAPACK using
recent versions of <code>gcc</code> on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux, see <a href="#New-platforms">New platforms</a>.

   <p>Please <strong>do</strong> bear in mind that using <samp><span class="option">--with-lapack</span></samp> is
`definitely <strong>not</strong> recommended': it is provided <strong>only</strong>
because it is necessary on some platforms.

<p><a name="Caveats"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">A.3.3 Caveats</h4>

<p>As with all libraries, you need to ensure that they and R were
compiled with compatible compilers and flags.  For example, this has
meant that on Sun Sparc using the native compilers the flag
<samp><span class="option">-dalign</span></samp> is needed so <code>sunperf</code> can be used.

   <p>On some systems it is necessary that an external <acronym>BLAS</acronym>/LAPACK
was built with the same FORTRAN compiler used to build R: known
problems are with R built with <samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp>, see <a href="#Using-gfortran">Using gfortran</a>.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix B Configuration on a Unix-alike</h2>

<p><a name="Configuration-options"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.1 Configuration options</h3>

<p><samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> has many options: running

<pre class="example">     ./configure --help
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will give a list.  Probably the most important ones not covered
elsewhere are (defaults in brackets)

     <dl>
<dt><samp><span class="option">--with-x</span></samp><dd>use the X Window System [yes]
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--x-includes=</span><var>DIR</var></samp><dd>X include files are in <var>DIR</var>
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--x-libraries=</span><var>DIR</var></samp><dd>X library files are in <var>DIR</var>
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--with-readline</span></samp><dd>use readline library (if available) [yes]
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--enable-R-profiling</span></samp><dd>attempt to compile support for <code>Rprof()</code> [yes]
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--enable-memory-profiling</span></samp><dd>attempt to compile support for <code>Rprofmem()</code> and <code>tracemem()</code> [no]
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span></samp><dd>build R as a shared/dynamic library [no]
<br><dt><samp><span class="option">--enable-BLAS-shlib</span></samp><dd>build the <acronym>BLAS</acronym> as a shared/dynamic library [yes, except on AIX]
</dl>

<p class="noindent">You can use <samp><span class="option">--without-foo</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">--disable-foo</span></samp> for the
negatives.

   <p>You will want to use <samp><span class="option">--disable-R-profiling</span></samp> if you are building
a profiled executable of R (e.g. with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-pg)</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>Flag <samp><span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span></samp> causes the make process to build R as
a dynamic (shared) library, typically called <samp><span class="file">libR.so</span></samp>, and link
the main R executable <samp><span class="file">R.bin</span></samp> against that library.  This can
only be done if all the code (including system libraries) can be
compiled into a dynamic library, and there may be a
performance<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-24" name="fnd-24"><sup>24</sup></a> penalty.  So you probably
only want this if you will be using an application which embeds R. 
Note that C code in packages installed on an R system linked with
<samp><span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span></samp> is linked against the dynamic library and so
such packages cannot be used from an R system built in the default
way.  Also, because packages are linked against R they are on some
OSes also linked against the dynamic libraries R itself is linked
against, and this can lead to symbol conflicts.

   <p>If you need to re-configure R with different options you may need to run
<code>make clean</code> or even <code>make distclean</code> before doing so.

<p><a name="Internationalization-support"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.2 Internationalization support</h3>

<p>Translation of messages is supported via <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>gettext</code>
unless disabled by the configure option <samp><span class="option">--disable-nls</span></samp> or the
underlying OS has insufficiently standard C functions to support it. 
The <code>configure</code> report will show <code>NLS</code> as one of the
`Additional capabilities' if support has been compiled in, and running
in an English locale (but not the <code>C</code> locale) will include

<pre class="example">       Natural language support but running in an English locale
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in the greeting on starting R.

<p><a name="Configuration-variables"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.3 Configuration variables</h3>

<p><a name="index-configure-83"></a>If you need or want to set certain configure variables to something
other than their default, you can do that by either editing the file
<samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> (which documents many of the variables you might want
to set: others can be seen in file <samp><span class="file">etc/Renviron.in</span></samp>) or on the
command line as

<pre class="example">     ./configure <var>VAR</var>=<var>value</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you are building in a directory different from the sources, there can
be copies of <samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> in the source and the build directories,
and both will be read (in that order).  In addition, if there is a file
<samp><span class="file">~/.R/config</span></samp> (or failing that<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-25" name="fnd-25"><sup>25</sup></a>
<code>~/.Rconfig</code>), it is read between the <samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> files in
the source and the build directories.

   <p>There is also a general <samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp> mechanism for
<samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> files, which are read before any of those mentioned
in the previous paragraph.  This looks first at a file specified by the
<a name="index-CONFIG_005fSITE-84"></a>environment variable <samp><span class="env">CONFIG_SITE</span></samp>, and if not is set at files such
as <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/share/config.site</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local/etc/config.site</span></samp> in the area (exemplified by
<samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> where R) would be installed.

   <p>These variables are <em>precious</em>, implying that they do not have to
be exported to the environment, are kept in the cache even if not
specified on the command line and checked for consistency between two
configure runs (provided that caching is used), and are kept during
automatic reconfiguration as if having been passed as command line
arguments, even if no cache is used.

   <p>See the variable output section of <code>configure --help</code> for a list of
all these variables.

   <p>If you find you need to alter configure variables, it is worth noting
that some settings may be cached in the file <samp><span class="file">config.cache</span></samp>, and it
is a good idea to remove that file (if it exists) before re-configuring. 
Note that caching is turned <em>off</em> by default: use the command line
option <samp><span class="option">--config-cache</span></samp> (or <samp><span class="option">-C</span></samp>) to enable caching.

<p><a name="Setting-paper-size"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.3.1 Setting paper size</h4>

<p><a name="index-R_005fPAPERSIZE-85"></a>One common variable to change is <samp><span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span></samp>, which defaults to
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a4</span></samp>&rsquo;, not &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">letter</span></samp>&rsquo;.  (Valid values are &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a4</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">letter</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">legal</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">executive</span></samp>&rsquo;.)

   <p>This is used both when configuring R to set the default, and when
running R to override the default.  It is also used to set the
papersize when making DVI and PDF manuals.

   <p>The configure default will most often be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">a4</span></samp>&rsquo; if <samp><span class="env">R_PAPERSIZE</span></samp>
is unset.  (If the (Debian Linux) program <samp><span class="command">paperconf</span></samp> is found
<a name="index-PAPERSIZE-86"></a>or the environment variable <samp><span class="env">PAPERSIZE</span></samp> is set, these are used to
produce the default.)

<p><a name="Setting-the-browsers"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.3.2 Setting the browsers</h4>

<p><a name="index-R_005fBROWSER-87"></a>Another precious variable is <samp><span class="env">R_BROWSER</span></samp>, the default HTML browser, which
should take a value of an executable in the user's path or specify
a full path.

   <p><a name="index-R_005fPDFVIEWER-88"></a>Its counterpart for PDF files is  <samp><span class="env">R_PDFVIEWER</span></samp>.

<p><a name="Compilation-flags"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">B.3.3 Compilation flags</h4>

<p>If you have libraries and header files, e.g., for <acronym>GNU</acronym>
readline, in non-system directories, use the variables <code>LDFLAGS</code>
(for libraries, using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L</span></samp>&rsquo; flags to be passed to the linker) and
<code>CPPFLAGS</code> (for header files, using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I</span></samp>&rsquo; flags to be passed to
the C/C++ preprocessors), respectively, to specify these locations. 
These default to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L/usr/local/lib</span></samp>&rsquo; (<code>LDFLAGS</code>,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-L/usr/local/lib64</span></samp>&rsquo; on most 64-bit Linux OSes) and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-I/usr/local/include</span></samp>&rsquo; (<code>CPPFLAGS</code>) to catch the most common
cases.  If libraries are still not found, then maybe your
compiler/linker does not support re-ordering of <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> flags (this has been reported to be a problem on HP-UX with
the native <samp><span class="command">cc</span></samp>).  In this case, use a different compiler (or a
front end shell script which does the re-ordering).

   <p>These flags can also be used to build a faster-running version of R. 
On most platforms using <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, having &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O3</span></samp>&rsquo; in
<code>CFLAGS</code> produces worthwhile performance gains.  On systems using
the <acronym>GNU</acronym> linker (especially those using R as a shared
library), it is likely that including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-Wl,-O1</span></samp>&rsquo; in <code>LDFLAGS</code>
is worthwhile, and on recent systems
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">'-Bdirect,--hash-style=both,-Wl,-O1'</span></samp>&rsquo; is recommended at
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/192624/">http://lwn.net/Articles/192624/</a>.  Tuning compilation to a
specific <acronym>CPU</acronym> family (e.g. &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-mtune=native</span></samp>&rsquo; for
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>) can give worthwhile performance gains, especially on
older architectures such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<p><a name="Setting-the-shell"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.4 Setting the shell</h3>

<p>By default the shell scripts such as <samp><span class="file">R</span></samp> will be &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!/bin/sh</span></samp>&rsquo;
scripts (or using the <samp><span class="env">SHELL</span></samp> chosen by <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>).  This is
almost always satisfactory, but on a few systems <samp><span class="file">/bin/sh</span></samp> is not a
Bourne shell or clone, and the shell to be used can be changed by
setting the configure variable <samp><span class="env">R_SHELL</span></samp> to a suitable value (a full
path to a shell, e.g. <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/bin/bash</span></samp>).

<p><a name="Using-make"></a>

<h3 class="section">B.5 Using make</h3>

<p><a name="index-make-92"></a>
To compile R, you will most likely find it easiest to use
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, although the Sun <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> works on
Solaris.  The native <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> has been reported to fail on SGI
Irix 6.5 and Alpha/OSF1 (aka Tru64).

   <p>To build in a separate directory you need a <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> that uses the
<code>VPATH</code> variable, for example <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, or Sun
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> on Solaris 7 or later.

   <p><samp><span class="command">dmake</span></samp> has also been used. e.g, on Solaris 10.

   <p>If you want to use a <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> by another name, for example if your
<acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> is called &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gmake</span></samp>&rsquo;, you need to set the
variable <code>MAKE</code> at configure time, for example

   <p>The search mechanism can be changed using the configure variable

running <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>, or use the configure variable <code>F77</code> to
specify its full path.

   <p>If your FORTRAN libraries are in slightly peculiar places, you should

sure that all libraries are on this path.

   <p>Note that only FORTRAN compilers which convert identifiers to lower case

   <p>You must set whatever compilation flags (if any) are needed to ensure
that FORTRAN <code>integer</code> is equivalent to a C <code>int</code> pointer and
FORTRAN <code>double precision</code> is equivalent to a C <code>double</code>
pointer.  This is checked during the configuration process.

   <p>Some of the FORTRAN code makes use of <code>COMPLEX*16</code> variables, which
is a Fortran 90 extension.  This is checked for at configure
time<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-27" name="fnd-27"><sup>27</sup></a>, but you may need to avoid

<h4 class="subsection">B.6.1 Using gfortran</h4>

<p><samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp> is the F95 compiler that is part of
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;4.<var>x</var>.<var>y</var>.  There were problems compiling
R with the first release (<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;4.0.0) and more with
pre-releases, but these are resolved in later versions.

   <p>On Linux &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; systems there is an incompatibility in the
return conventions for double-complex functions between
<samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">g77</span></samp> which results in the final example
in <code>example(eigen)</code> hanging or segfaulting under external <acronym>BLAS</acronym>s
built under <samp><span class="command">g77</span></samp>.  This should be detected by a
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> test.

   <p>The default <code>FFLAGS</code> and <code>FCFLAGS</code> chosen (by
<samp><span class="command">autoconf</span></samp>) for a <acronym>GNU</acronym> FORTRAN compiler is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-g

&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux in the past, but seems fine with
<samp><span class="command">gfortran 4.4.4</span></samp> and later: for <code>gfortran 4.3.x</code> set
<code>FFLAGS</code> and <code>FCFLAGS</code> to use at most &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-O</span></samp>&rsquo;.

<p class="noindent">Library paths specified as <samp><span class="option">-L/lib/path</span></samp> in <code>LDFLAGS</code> are
<a name="index-LD_005fLIBRARY_005fPATH-103"></a>collected together and prepended to <samp><span class="env">LD_LIBRARY_PATH</span></samp> (or your

<samp><span class="option">-rpath</span></samp> flags.

   <p>Variables such as <samp><span class="env">CPICFLAGS</span></samp> are determined where possible by
<samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>.  Some systems allows two types of PIC flags, for
example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fpic</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-fPIC</span></samp>&rsquo;, and if they differ the first
allows only a limited number of symbols in a shared object.  Since R
as a shared library has about 6200 symbols, if in doubt use the larger
version.

   <p>To compile a profiling version of R, one might for example want to
use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MAIN_CFLAGS=-pg</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MAIN_FFLAGS=-pg</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MAIN_LDFLAGS=-pg</span></samp>&rsquo; on platforms where &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-pg</span></samp>&rsquo; cannot be used
with position-independent code.

   <p><strong>Beware</strong>: it may be necessary to set <code>CFLAGS</code> and
<code>FFLAGS</code> in ways compatible with the libraries to be used: one
possible issue is the alignment of doubles, another is the way
structures are passed.

   <p>On some platforms <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> will select additional flags for
<code>CFLAGS</code>, <code>CPPFLAGS</code>, <code>FFLAGS</code>, <code>CXXFLAGS</code> and
<code>LIBS</code> in <code>R_XTRA_CFLAGS</code> (and so on).  These are for options
which are always required, for example to force <acronym>IEC</acronym>&nbsp;60559
compliance.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix C Platform notes</h2>

<p>This section provides some notes on building R on different Unix-alike
platforms.  These notes are based on tests run on one or two systems in
each case with particular sets of compilers and support libraries. 
Success in building R depends on the proper installation and functioning
of support software; your results may differ if you have other versions
of compilers and support libraries.

   <p>Older versions of this manual (for R &lt; 2.10.0) contain notes on
platforms such as HP-UX, IRIX and Alpha/OSF1 for which we have had no
recent reports.

<p><a name="X11-issues"></a>

<h3 class="section">C.1 X11 issues</h3>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X11()</span></samp>&rsquo; graphics device is the one started automatically on
Unix-alikes when plotting.  As its name implies, it displays on a (local
or remote) X server, and relies on the services and in particular the
fonts provided by the X server.  So if you sometimes use R at a
console and sometimes remotely from an X11 session running on a Windows
machine, you may have to setup the fonts differently for the two usages.

   <p>The `modern' version of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X11()</span></samp>&rsquo; device is based on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">cairo</span></samp>&rsquo;
graphics and uses &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fontconfig</span></samp>&rsquo; to pick and render fonts.  This is
done on the server, and although there can be selection issues, they are
more amenable than the issues with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X11()</span></samp>&rsquo; discussed in the rest of
this section.

   <p>When X11 was designed, most displays were around 75dpi, whereas today
they are of the order of 100dpi or even higher.  If you find that X11()
is reporting<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-30" name="fnd-30"><sup>30</sup></a> missing font sizes, especially larger ones, it is likely
that you are not using scalable fonts and have not installed the 100dpi
versions of the X11 fonts.  The names and details differ by system, but
will likely have something like Fedora's
<pre class="example">     xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi
     xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi
     xorg-x11-fonts-truetype
     xorg-x11-fonts-Type1
     xorg-x11-fonts-cyrillic
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">and you need to ensure that the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-100dpi</span></samp>&rsquo; versions are installed
and on the X11 font path (check via <samp><span class="command">xset -q</span></samp>).  The
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X11()</span></samp>&rsquo; device does try to set a pointsize and not a pixel size:
laptop users may find the default setting of 12 too large (although very
frequently laptop screens are set to a fictitious dpi to appear like a
scaled-down desktop screen).

   <p>More complicated problems can occur in non-Western-European locales, so
if you are using one, the first thing to check is that things work in
the <code>C</code> locale.  The likely issues are a failure to find any fonts
or glyphs being rendered incorrectly (often as a pair of ASCII
characters).  X11 works by being asked for a font specification and
coming up with its idea of a close match.  For text (as distinct from
the symbols used by plotmath), the specification is the first element of
the option <code>"X11fonts"</code> which defaults to

<pre class="example">     "-adobe-helvetica-%s-%s-*-*-%d-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"
</pre>
   <p>If you are using a single-byte encoding, for example ISO 8859-2 in
Eastern Europe or KOI8-R in Russian, use <samp><span class="command">xlsfonts</span></samp> to find an
appropriate family of fonts in your encoding (the last field in the
listing).  If you find none, it is likely that you need to install
further font packages, such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xorg-x11-fonts-cyrillic</span></samp>&rsquo; shown in
the listing above.

   <p>Multi-byte encodings (most commonly UTF-8) are even more complicated. 
There are few fonts in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">iso10646-1</span></samp>&rsquo;, the Unicode encoding, and they
only contain a subset of the available glyphs (and are often fixed-width
designed for use in terminals).  In such locales <em>fontsets</em> are
used, made up of fonts encoded in other encodings.  If the locale you
are using has an entry in the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">XLC_LOCALE</span></samp>&rsquo; directory (typically
<samp><span class="file">/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale</span></samp>, it is likely that all you need to do
is to pick a suitable font specification that has fonts in the encodings
specified there.  If not, you may have to get hold of a suitable locale
entry for X11.  This may mean that, for example, Japanese text can be
displayed when running in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ja_JP.UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo; but not when running in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_GB.UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo; on the same machine (although on some systems many
UTF-8 X11 locales are aliased to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">en_US.UTF-8</span></samp>&rsquo; which covers several
character sets, e.g. ISO 8859-1 (Western European), JISX0208 (Kanji),
KSC5601 (Korean), GB2312 (Chinese Han) and JISX0201 (Kana)).

   <p>On some systems scalable fonts are available covering a wide range of
glyphs.  One source is TrueType fonts, and these can provide high
coverage.  Another is Type 1 fonts: the URW set of Type 1 fonts provides
standard typefaces such as Helvetica with a larger coverage of Unicode
glyphs than the standard X11 bitmaps, including Cyrillic.  These are
generally not part of the default install, and the X server may need to
be configured to use them.  They might be under the X11 <samp><span class="file">fonts</span></samp>
directory or elsewhere, for example,

<pre class="example">     /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1
     /usr/share/fonts/ja/TrueType

   <p><a name="Linux"></a>

<h3 class="section">C.2 Linux</h3>

<p><a name="index-Linux-104"></a>
Linux is the main development platform for R, so compilation from the
sources is normally straightforward with the standard compilers.

   <p>Remember that some package management systems (such as <acronym>RPM</acronym> and
deb) make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
developer version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-devel</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-dev</span></samp>&rsquo;: you need both versions
installed.  So please check the <code>configure</code> output to see if the
expected features are detected: if for example &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">readline</span></samp>&rsquo; is
missing add the developer package.  (On most systems you will also need
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ncurses</span></samp>&rsquo; and its developer package, although these should be
dependencies of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">readline</span></samp>&rsquo; package(s).)

   <p>When R has been installed from a binary distribution there are
sometimes problems with missing components such as the FORTRAN
compiler.  Searching the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-help</span></samp>&rsquo; archives will normally reveal
what is needed.

   <p>It seems that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux accepts non-PIC code in shared
libraries, but this is not necessarily so on other platforms, in
particular on 64-bit <acronym>CPU</acronym>s such as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo;.  So care
can be needed with <acronym>BLAS</acronym> libraries and when building R as a
shared library to ensure that position-independent code is used in any
static libraries (such as the Tcl/Tk libraries, <code>libpng</code>,
<code>libjpeg</code> and <code>zlib</code>) which might be linked against. 
Fortunately these are normally built as shared libraries with the
exception of the ATLAS <acronym>BLAS</acronym> libraries.

   <p>The default optimization settings chosen for <code>CFLAGS</code> etc are
conservative.  It is likely that using <samp><span class="option">-mtune</span></samp> will result in
significant performance improvements on recent CPUs (especially for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo;): one possibility is to add <samp><span class="option">-mtune=native</span></samp> for
the best possible performance on the machine on which R is being
installed: if the compilation is for a site-wide installation, it may
still be desirable to use something like <samp><span class="option">-mtume=core2</span></samp>.  It is
also possible to increase the optimization levels to <samp><span class="option">-O3</span></samp>:
however for many versions of the compilers this has caused problems in
at least one <acronym>CRAN</acronym> package.

   <p>For platforms with both 64- and 32-bit support, it is likely that

<pre class="example">     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib64 -L/usr/local/lib"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is appropriate since most (but not all) software installs its 64-bit
libraries in <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/lib64</span></samp>.  To build a 32-bit version of R
on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo; with Fedora 8 we used

<pre class="example">     CC="gcc -m32"
     CXX="g++ -m32"
     F77="gfortran -m32"
     FC=${F77}
     OBJC=${CC}
     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
     LIBnn=lib
</pre>
   <p>64-bit versions of Linux are built with support for files &gt; 2Gb, and
32-bit versions will be if possible unless <samp><span class="option">--disable-largefile</span></samp>
is specified.

   <p>There are known problems with several early versions of
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;4, but <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;4.1.0 and later have been
tested extensively.

   <p>To build a 64-bit version of R on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ppc64</span></samp>&rsquo; (also known as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">powerpc64</span></samp>&rsquo;) with <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;4.1.1, Ei-ji Nakama used

<h4 class="subsection">C.2.1 Intel compilers</h4>

<p>Intel compilers have been used under &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86_64</span></samp>&rsquo;

</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> will add &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-c99</span></samp>&rsquo; to <code>CC</code> for
C99-compliance.  This causes warnings with <code>icc</code> 10 and later, so
use <code>CC="icc -std=c99"</code> there.  The flag <samp><span class="option">-wd188</span></samp> suppresses
a large number of warnings about the enumeration type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Rboolean</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
Because the Intel C compiler sets &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">__GNUC__</span></samp>&rsquo; without complete
emulation of <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, we suggest adding <code>CPPFLAGS=-no-gcc</code>.

   <p>To maintain correct <acronym>IEC</acronym>&nbsp;60559 arithmetic you most likely
need add flags to <code>CFLAGS</code>, <code>FFLAGS</code> and <code>CXXFLAGS</code> such
as <samp><span class="option">-mp</span></samp> (shown above) or <samp><span class="option">-fp-model precise -fp-model
source</span></samp>, depending on the compiler version.

<h3 class="section">C.3 FreeBSD</h3>

<p><a name="index-FreeBSD-105"></a>
Rainer Hurling has reported success on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">amd64</span></samp>&rsquo; FreeBSD 9.0 (and
on earlier versions in the past), and Brian Ripley tested
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">amd64</span></samp>&rsquo; FreeBSD 8.2.  Since Darwin (the base OS of Mac OS X) is
based on FreeBSD we find testing on Darwin tends to pick up most
potential problems on FreeBSD.  However, FreeBSD lacks adequate
collation support for multi-byte locales (but a port of ICU is
available), and does not yet implement C99 complex math functions (for
which R's substitutes are used).

   <p>The native BSD <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> suffices to build R but a number of
packages require <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, despite the
recommendations of the &ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo; manual.  (The BSD
version is <samp><span class="command">bsdmake</span></samp> on Darwin.)

   <p>The simplest way to get the additional sofware needed to build R is
to install a pre-compiled version first, e.g. by

<pre class="example">     pkg_add -r R

   <p class="noindent">(on the system this was tested on, this installed Tcl, Tk, blas, lapack

You can build R as a Unix application on Mac OS X using the Apple
Developer Tools (`Xcode') and <samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp>.  You may also need to
install an X sub-system or configure with <samp><span class="option">--without-x</span></samp>.  The X
window manager is part of the standard Mac OS X distribution since Mac
OS X version 10.3 (Panther), but it is typically not pre-installed prior
to 10.5 (Leopard).  You will also need <samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp> and
<code>libreadline</code> (or configure with <samp><span class="option">--without-readline</span></samp>).

<h4 class="subsection">C.4.1 64-bit builds</h4>

<p>64-bit builds are supported on 10.5.x (Leopard) and later.  All that is
needed is to select suitable compiler options, e.g. for recent Intel
Macs

<pre class="example">     CC='gcc -arch x86_64'
     CXX='g++ -arch x86_64'
     F77='gfortran -arch x86_64'
     FC='gfortran -arch x86_64'
     OBJC='gcc -arch x86_64'
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">in <samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> or on the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> command line.  (Or
on Leopard specify <samp><span class="option">gcc-4.2</span></samp> etc: those versions are the default
on Snow Leopard.)

<p><a name="Snow-Leopard"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">C.4.2 Snow Leopard</h4>

<p>On Snow Leopard you will most likely to need to specify <samp><span class="option">-arch
i386</span></samp> for a 32-bit build and <samp><span class="option">-arch x86_64</span></samp> for a 64-bit build:
the Apple compilers default to 64-bit but the <samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp>
supplied on <a href="http://r.research.att.com">http://r.research.att.com</a> defaults to 32-bit.

   <p>Another quirk is that the X11 libraries are not in the default linking
path, so something like &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib</span></samp>&rsquo; may be required (or
you can use the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp> options
<samp><span class="option">--x-includes=/usr/X11/include --x-libraries=/usr/X11/lib.</span></samp>).

   <p>So for a 64-bit build of R you need a file <samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> in the
top-level build directory containing

<pre class="example">     CC='gcc -arch x86_64'
     CXX='g++ -arch x86_64'
     F77='gfortran -arch x86_64'
     FC='gfortran -arch x86_64'
     OBJC='gcc -arch x86_64'
     LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">whereas for a 32-bit build it should have

<pre class="example">     CC='gcc -arch i386'
     CXX='g++ -arch i386'
     F77='gfortran -arch i386'
     FC='gfortran -arch i386'
     OBJC='gcc -arch i386'
     LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib
</pre>
   <p><a name="Solaris"></a>

<h3 class="section">C.5 Solaris</h3>

<p><a name="index-Solaris-109"></a>
R has been built successfully on Solaris 10 (both Sparc and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86</span></samp>&rsquo;) using the (zero cost) Oracle Solaris Studio 12 compilers:
there has been some success with
<samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;4/<samp><span class="command">gfortran</span></samp>, mainly on Sparc.  Sun packages
for R are available from <a href="http://www.sunfreeware.com/">http://www.sunfreeware.com/</a> for both
32-bit architectures, but recently have often been several versions old. 
(Recent Sun machines are AMD Opterons or Intel Xeons (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">amd64</span></samp>&rsquo;)
rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86</span></samp>&rsquo;, but 32-bit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86</span></samp>&rsquo; executables are the
default.)

   <p>There are also reports of success on OpenSolaris (also known as Solaris
Express Community Edition, and dropped in August 2010) on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86</span></samp>&rsquo;.

   <p>The Solaris versions of several of the tools needed to build R
(e.g. <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp>, <samp><span class="command">ar</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp>) are in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/ccs/bin</span></samp>, so if using those tools ensure this is in your
path.  Also, a version of the preferred <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">tar</span></samp> is
(if installed) in <samp><span class="file">/usr/sfw/bin</span></samp>, as sometimes are tools like
<samp><span class="command">makeinfo</span></samp>.  It may be necessary to avoid the tools in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/ucb</span></samp>: in particular <samp><span class="file">/usr/ucb/tr</span></samp> has caused problems in
the past.  POSIX-compliant versions of some tools can be found in
<samp><span class="file">/usr/xpg4/bin</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">/usr/xpg6/bin</span></samp>.

   <p>A large selection of Open Source software can be installed from
<a href="http://www.opencsw.org">http://www.opencsw.org</a> (and also <a href="http://www.blastwave.org">http://www.blastwave.org</a>)
via <samp><span class="command">pkg-get</span></samp>, by default installed under <samp><span class="file">/opt/csw</span></samp>.

   <p>You will need <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>libiconv</code> and <code>readline</code>: the
Solaris version of <code>iconv</code> is not sufficiently powerful.

   <p>The native <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> suffices to build R but a small number of
rogue packages require <acronym>GNU</acronym> <samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> (many without
declaring it as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SystemRequirements</span></samp>&rsquo; in the <samp><span class="file">DESCRIPTION</span></samp> file).

   <p>Some people have reported that the Solaris <code>libintl</code> needs to be
avoided, for example by using <samp><span class="option">--disable-nls</span></samp> or
<samp><span class="option">--with-included-gettext</span></samp> or using <code>libintl</code> from OpenCSW.

   <p>When using the Oracle compilers<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-32" name="fnd-32"><sup>32</sup></a> do <em>not</em> specify <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp>, as this
disables <acronym>IEEE</acronym> arithmetic and <samp><span class="command">make check</span></samp> will fail.

   <p>For the Solaris Studio compilers a little juggling of paths was needed to
ensure <acronym>GNU</acronym> <code>libiconv</code> is used rather than the Solaris
<code>iconv</code>: at one time we used

<pre class="example">     CC="cc -xc99"
     CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/csw/include
     CFLAGS="-O -xlibmieee"
     F77=f95
     FFLAGS=-O4
     CXX="CC -library=stlport4"
     CXXFLAGS=-O
     FC=f95
     FCFLAGS=$FFLAGS
     FCLIBS=-lfai -lfsu
     LDFLAGS=-L/opt/csw/lib
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to ensure that the <code>libiconv</code> version of <samp><span class="file">iconv.h</span></samp> was found,
and later used self-compiled versions of <code>libiconv</code> and
<code>readline</code> from <samp><span class="file">/usr/local</span></samp> (replacing <samp><span class="file">/opt/csw</span></samp> in the
flags).  For a 64-bit target add <samp><span class="option">-m64</span></samp> to the compiler macros
and use something like <code>LDFLAGS=-L/opt/csw/lib/sparcv9</code> or
<code>LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib/amd64</code> as appropriate.

   <p>With Solaris Studio 12.2 on Sparc, <code>FCLIBS</code> needs to be

<pre class="example">     FCLIBS=-lfai -lfai2 -lfsu
</pre>
   <p>(and possibly other Fortran libraries, but this suffices for the
packages currently on CRAN).

<p class="noindent">By default the Solaris Studio compilers do not by default conform to the C99
standard (appendix F 8.9) on the return values of functions such as
<code>log</code>: use <samp><span class="option">-xlibmieee</span></samp> to ensure this.  Also, errors have
been reported on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">amd64</span></samp>&rsquo; if <samp><span class="option">-xc99</span></samp> is omitted.

   <p>You can target specific Sparc architectures for (slightly) higher
performance: Oracle recommend

<pre class="example">     <span class="roman">32-bit:</span> -xtarget=ultra3 -xarch=v8plusa
     <span class="roman">64-bit:</span> -xtarget=ultra3 -xarch=sparcvis2
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(in <code>CFLAGS</code> etc.) as a good compromise for recent Sparc chipsets. 
Using <code>-libmil</code> allows more system mathematical functions to be inlined.

   <p>On &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">x86</span></samp>&rsquo; you will get marginally higher performance <em>via</em>

<pre class="example">     CFLAGS="-O5 -xc99 -xlibmieee -xlibmil -nofstore -xtarget=native"
     FFLAGS="-O5 -libmil -nofstore -xtarget=native"
     CXXFLAGS="-O5 -xlibmil -nofstore -xtarget=native"
     SAFE_FFLAGS="-libmil -fstore -xtarget=native"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">but the use of <code>-no-fstore</code> can be less numerically stable.

   <p>The Solaris Studio compilers provide several implementations of the C++
standard which select both the set of headers and a C++ runtime library. 
These are selected by the <samp><span class="option">-library</span></samp> flag, which as it is needed
for both compiling and linking is best specified as part of the
compiler.  The examples above use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stlport4</span></samp>&rsquo;, currently the most
modern of the options: the default (but still needed to be specified as
it is needed for linking) is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cstd</span></samp>&rsquo; which dates from 1998: see
<a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/cmp_stlport_libCstd.html">http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/cmp_stlport_libCstd.html</a>. 
Note though that most external Solaris C++ libraries will have been
built with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Cstd</span></samp>&rsquo; and so an R package using such a package also
needs to be.  Occasionally the flag <samp><span class="option">-library=stlport4,Crun</span></samp> is
needed.

   <p>Several CRAN packages using C++ need the more liberal interpretation
given by adding

<pre class="example">     CXXFLAGS="-features=tmplrefstatic"
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-BLAS-library-110"></a><a name="index-LAPACK-library-111"></a>
The performance library <code>sunperf</code> is available for use with the
Solaris Studio compilers.  If selected as a <acronym>BLAS</acronym>, it must also
be selected as LAPACK <em>via</em> (for Solaris Studio 12.2)

<pre class="example">     ./configure --with-blas='-library=sunperf' --with-lapack
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This has often given test failures in the past, in several different
places.  For R 2.12.0, it fails in <samp><span class="file">tests/reg-tests-1b.R</span></samp> in the
BLAS test, and on some builds, including for &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">amd64</span></samp>&rsquo;, it fails
in <code>example(eigen)</code>.

<p><a name="Using-gcc"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">C.5.1 Using gcc</h4>

<p>If using <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>, ensure that the compiler was compiled for the
version of Solaris in use.  (This can be ascertained from <samp><span class="command">gcc
-v</span></samp>.)  <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> makes modified versions of some header files, and
several reports of problems were due to using <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp> compiled on
one version of Solaris on a later version.

   <p>Compilation for a 32-bit Sparc target with <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;4.3.3 needed

   <p><a name="index-R_005fSHELL-114"></a>On one AIX 6.x system it was necessary to use <samp><span class="env">R_SHELL</span></samp> to set the
default shell to be Bash rather than Zsh.

   <p>Kurt Hornik and Stefan Theussl at WU (Wirtschaftsuniversit&auml;t Wien)
successfully built R on a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">powerpc</span></samp>&rsquo; (8-<acronym>CPU</acronym> Power6
system) running AIX 6.1, configuring with or without
<samp><span class="option">--enable-R-shlib</span></samp> (Ei-ji Nakama's support is gratefully
acknowledged).

   <p>It helps to describe the WU build environment first.  A small part of
the software needed to build R and/or install packages is available
directly from the AIX Installation DVDs, e.g., Java 6, X11, and Perl. 
Additional open source software (OSS) is packaged for AIX in <samp><span class="file">.rpm</span></samp>
files and available from both IBM's &ldquo;AIX Toolbox for Linux
Applications&rdquo;
(<a href="http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/linux/">http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/linux/</a>) and
<a href="http://www.oss4aix.org/download/">http://www.oss4aix.org/download/</a>.  The latter website typically
offers more recent versions of the available OSS.  All tools needed and
libraries downloaded from these repositories (e.g., GCC, Make,
<code>libreadline</code>, etc.) are typically installed to
<samp><span class="file">/opt/freeware</span></samp>, hence corresponding executables are found in
<a name="index-PATH-115"></a><samp><span class="file">/opt/freeware/bin</span></samp> which thus needs to be in <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> for using
these tools.  As on other Unix systems one needs <acronym>GNU</acronym>
<code>libiconv</code> as the AIX version of iconv is not sufficiently
powerful.  Additionally, for proper Unicode compatibility one should
install the corresponding package from the ICU project
(<a href="http://www.icu-project.org/download/">http://www.icu-project.org/download/</a>), which offers pre-compiled
binaries for various platforms which in case of AIX can be installed via
unpacking the tarball to the root file system.  For full LaTeX
support one can install the TeX Live DVD distribution
(<a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">http://www.tug.org/texlive/</a>): it is recommended to update the
distribution using the <code>tlmgr</code> update manager.  For 64-bit R builds
supporting Tcl/Tk this needs to installed from the sources as available
pre-compiled binaries supply only 32-bit shared objects.

   <p>The recent WU testing was done using compilers from both the
<acronym>GNU</acronym> Compiler Collection (version 4.2.4) which is available
from one of the above OSS repositories, and the IBM C/C++ (XL C/C++
10.01) as well as FORTRAN (XL Fortran 12.01) compilers
(<a href="http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/byproduct.jsp#X">http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/byproduct.jsp#X</a>).

   <p>To compile for a 64-bit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">powerpc</span></samp>&rsquo; (Power6 <acronym>CPU</acronym>) target
one can use

<pre class="example">     CC ="gcc -maix64 -pthread"
     CXX="g++ -maix64 -pthread"
     FC="gfortran -maix64 -pthread"
     F77="gfortran -maix64 -pthread"
     CFLAGS="-O2 -g -mcpu=power6"
     FFLAGS="-O2 -g -mcpu=power6"
     FCFLAGS="-O2 -g -mcpu=power6"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for the GCC and

<pre class="example">     CC=xlc
     CXX=xlc++
     FC=xlf
     F77=xlf
     CFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict -ma"
     FFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict"
     FCFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict"
     CXXFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">for the IBM XL compilers.  For the latter, it is important to note that
the decision for generating 32-bit or 64-bit code is done by setting the
<a name="index-OBJECT_005fMODE-116"></a><samp><span class="env">OBJECT_MODE</span></samp> environment variable appropriately (recommended) or
using an additional compiler flag (<samp><span class="option">-q32</span></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-q64</span></samp>).  By
default the IBM XL compilers produce 32 bit code.  Thus, to build R with
64-bit support one needs to either export <samp><span class="env">OBJECT_MODE=64</span></samp> in the
environment or, alternatively, use the <samp><span class="option">-q64</span></samp> compiler options.

   <p>It is strongly recommended to install Bash and use it as the configure
shell, e.g., via setting <code>CONFIG_SHELL=/usr/bin/bash</code> in the
environment, and to use <acronym>GNU</acronym> Make (e.g., via
(<code>MAKE=/opt/freeware/bin/make</code>).

   <p>Further installation instructions to set up a proper R development
environment can be found in the &ldquo;R on AIX&rdquo; project on R-Forge
(<a href="http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/aix/">http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/aix/</a>).

<p><a name="Cygwin"></a>

<h3 class="section">C.7 Cygwin</h3>

<p>The Cygwin emulation layer on Windows can be treated as a Unix-alike OS. 
This is unsupported, but experiments have been conducted and a few
workarounds added for R 2.6.0.  R 2.13.0 will require C99 complex
type support, which should appear in 2011: versions up to 2.12.2 will
use the little-tested (and buggy at least in R 2.10.0 to 2.12.1)
emulation code.

   <p>Only building as a shared library works,<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-34" name="fnd-34"><sup>34</sup></a> so use e.g

<pre class="example">     ./configure --disable-nls --enable-R-shlib
     make
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">NLS does work if required, although adding
<samp><span class="option">--with-included-gettext</span></samp> is preferable.  You will see many
warnings about the use of auto-import.

   <p>Note that this gives you a command-line application using <code>readline</code>
for command editing.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">X11</span></samp>&rsquo; graphics device will work if a
suitable X server is running, and the standard Unix-alike ways of
installing source packages work.  There was a bug in the
<samp><span class="file">/usr/lib/tkConfig.sh</span></samp> script in the version we looked at, which
needs to have

<pre class="example">     TK_LIB_SPEC='-ltk84'
</pre>
   <p>The overhead of using shell scripts makes this noticeably slower than a

<h3 class="section">C.8 New platforms</h3>

<p>There are a number of sources of problems when installing R on a new
hardware/OS platform.  These include

   <p><strong>Floating Point Arithmetic</strong>: R requires arithmetic compliant
with <acronym>IEC</acronym>&nbsp;60559, also known as <acronym>IEEE</acronym>&nbsp;754. 
This mandates the use of plus and minus infinity and <code>NaN</code> (not a
number) as well as specific details of rounding.  Although almost all
current FPUs can support this, selecting such support can be a pain. 
The problem is that there is no agreement on how to set the signalling
behaviour; Sun/Sparc, SGI/IRIX and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux require no
special action, FreeBSD requires a call to (the macro)
<code>fpsetmask(0)</code> and OSF1 requires that computation be done with a
<samp><span class="option">-ieee_with_inexact</span></samp> flag etc.  On a new platform you must find
out the magic recipe and add some code to make it work.  This can often
be done via the file <samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> which resides in the top level
directory.

   <p>Beware of using high levels of optimization, at least initially.  On
many compilers these reduce the degree of compliance to the
<acronym>IEEE</acronym> model.  For example, using <samp><span class="option">-fast</span></samp> on the Solaris
Studio compilers has caused R's <code>NaN</code> to be set incorrectly.

   <p><strong>Shared Objects</strong>: There seems to be very little agreement
across platforms on what needs to be done to build shared objects. 
there are many different combinations of flags for the compilers and
loaders.  <acronym>GNU</acronym> libtool cannot be used (yet), as it currently
does not fully support FORTRAN: one would need a shell wrapper for
this).  The technique we use is to first interrogate the X window system
about what it does (using <samp><span class="command">xmkmf</span></samp>), and then override this in
situations where we know better (for tools from the <acronym>GNU</acronym>
Compiler Collection and/or platforms we know about).  This typically
works, but you may have to manually override the results.  Scanning the
manual entries for <samp><span class="command">cc</span></samp> and <samp><span class="command">ld</span></samp> usually reveals the
correct incantation.  Once you know the recipe you can modify the file
<samp><span class="file">config.site</span></samp> (following the instructions therein) so that the
build will use these options.

   <p>It seems that <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>&nbsp;3.4.x and later on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux
defeat attempts by the LAPACK code to avoid computations entirely in
extended-precision registers, so file <samp><span class="file">src/modules/lapack/dlamc.f</span></samp>
may need to be compiled without optimization.  Set the configure
variable <samp><span class="env">SAFE_FFLAGS</span></samp> to the flags to be used for this file.  If
configure detects <acronym>GNU</acronym> FORTRAN it adds flag
<samp><span class="option">-ffloat-store</span></samp> to <samp><span class="env">FFLAGS</span></samp>.  (Other settings are needed when
using <samp><span class="command">icc</span></samp> on &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ix86</span></samp>&rsquo; Linux, for example.)

   <p>If you do manage to get R running on a new platform please let us
know about it so we can modify the configuration procedures to include
that platform.

   <p>If you are having trouble getting R to work on your platform please
feel free to use the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R-devel</span></samp>&rsquo; mailing list to ask questions.  We
have had a fair amount of practice at porting R to new platforms

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix D The Windows toolset</h2>

<p>If you want to build R or add-on packages from source in Windows, you
will need to collect, install and test an extensive set of tools.  See
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/</a> for the current
locations and other updates to these instructions.  (Most Windows users
will not need to build add-on packages from source; see <a href="#Add_002don-packages">Add-on packages</a> for details.)

   <p>We have found that the build process for R is quite sensitive to
the choice of tools: please follow our instructions <strong>exactly</strong>,
even to the choice of particular versions of the tools.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-35" name="fnd-35"><sup>35</sup></a>  The build process for add-on packages is somewhat more
forgiving, but we recommend using the exact toolset at first, and only
substituting other tools once you are familiar with the process.

   <p><em>This appendix contains a lot of prescriptive comments.  They are
here as a result of bitter experience.  Please do not report problems to
the R mailing lists unless you have followed all the prescriptions.</em>

   <p>We have collected most of the necessary tools (unfortunately not all,
due to license or size limitations) into an executable installer
named<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-36" name="fnd-36"><sup>36</sup></a>  <samp><span class="file">Rtools212.exe</span></samp>, available from
<a href="http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/">http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/</a>. You should download
and run it, choosing the default &ldquo;Package authoring installation&rdquo; to
build add-on packages, or the &ldquo;full installation&rdquo; if you intend to
build R.

   <p>You will need the following items to build R and packages. 
See the subsections below for detailed descriptions.
     <ul>
<li>The command line tools (in <samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp>)
<li>The MinGW toolchain to compile C, Fortran and C++. 
</ul>
   For installing simple source packages containing data or R source but
no compiled code, none of these are needed.  Perl is no longer needed to
build R nor to install nor develop source packages.

   <p>A complete build of R including PDF manuals, and producing the
installer will also need the following:
     <ul>
<li>LaTeX
<li>The Inno Setup installer
<li>(optional) <code>qpdf</code>
</ul>

   <p><a name="index-PATH-117"></a>It is important to set your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> properly.  The installer
<samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp> optionally sets the path to components that it
installs.

   <p>Your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> may include <samp><span class="file">.</span></samp> first, then the <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp>
directories of the tools, the compiler toolchain and LaTeX.  Do not
use filepaths containing spaces: you can always use the short forms
(found by <code>dir /x</code> at the Windows command line).  Network shares
(with paths starting <code>\\</code>) are not supported.

   <p>For example for a 32-bit build, all on one line,

<pre class="smallexample">     PATH=c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW\bin;c:\MiKTeX\miktex\bin;
          c:\R\bin\i386;c:\windows;c:\windows\system32
</pre>
   <p>It is essential that the directory containing the command line tools
comes first or second in the path: there are typically like-named
tools<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-37" name="fnd-37"><sup>37</sup></a> in other directories, and they will <strong>not</strong>
work. The ordering of the other directories is less important, but if
in doubt, use the order above.  If you install both the 32 bit and 64
bit toolchains from <samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp>, it should work to list both in
the path (as the automatic installer does), and this is needed if you
want to install or build binary packages containing both architectures
using the <samp><span class="command">--merge-multiarch</span></samp> option as described in
<a href="#Windows-packages">Windows packages</a>.  Other toolchains are more likely to conflict.

   <p>Our toolset contains copies of Cygwin DLLs that may conflict with other
ones on your system if both are in the path at once.  The normal
recommendation is to delete the older ones; however, at one time we
found our tools did not work with a newer version of the Cygwin DLLs, so
it may be safest not to have any other version of the Cygwin DLLs in your
path.

<p><a name="LaTeX"></a>

<h3 class="section">D.1 LaTeX</h3>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MiKTeX</span></samp>&rsquo; (<a href="http://www.miktex.org/">http://www.miktex.org/</a>) distribution of
LaTeX includes a suitable port of <code>pdftex</code>.  The `basic' version
of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">MiKTeX</span></samp>&rsquo; almost suffices (the <strong>grid</strong> vignettes need
<samp><span class="file">fancyvrb.sty</span></samp>), but it will install the 15Mb &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">lm</span></samp>&rsquo; package if
allowed to (although that is not actually used).  The <samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp>
installer does <em>not</em> include any version of LaTeX.

   <p><a name="index-R_005fRD4DVI-118"></a><a name="index-R_005fRD4PDF-119"></a>Please read <a href="#Making-the-manuals">Making the manuals</a> about how to make <samp><span class="file">refman.pdf</span></samp>
and set the environment variables <samp><span class="env">R_RD4DVI</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">R_RD4PDF</span></samp>
suitably; ensure you have the required fonts installed.

<p><a name="The-Inno-Setup-installer"></a>

<h3 class="section">D.2 The Inno Setup installer</h3>

<p>To make the installer package (<samp><span class="file">R-2.12.2-win.exe</span></samp>) we
currently require Inno Setup 5.3.7 or later (including 5.4.x) from
<a href="http://jrsoftware.org/">http://jrsoftware.org/</a>.  We use the Unicode version and recommend
that version be used.  This is <em>not</em> included in
<samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp>.

   <p>Copy file <samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist</span></samp> to
<samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/MkRules.local</span></samp> and edit it to set <code>ISDIR</code> to the
location where Inno Setup was installed.

<p><a name="The-command-line-tools"></a>

<h3 class="section">D.3 The command line tools</h3>

<p>This item is installed by the <samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp> installer.

<!-- INSTALL may use sh make zip -->
<!-- build uses make tar gzip -->
<!-- Rdiff.sh USED to use diff echo grep sed tr -->
<!-- Rd2dvi USED to use basename echo mkdir rm sed -->
<!-- src/library/Recommended/Makefile.win uses basename and tar -->
<!-- comm, sort, uniq are used in producing .def files -->
<!-- cmp is used in src/include/Makefile.win, tools/{copy,move}-if-change -->
<!-- cp is used as $(CP) in numerous Makefiles -->
<!-- cut is used to make RVER -->
<!-- date is used when building base and tools -->
<!-- diff is used by tools::Rdiff and tests/Makefile.common -->
<!-- expr is used in tools/GETVERSION -->
<!-- find is used in installer/Makefile -->
<!-- expr is used in tools/GETCONFIG -->
<!-- gzip is used in src/library/Makefile.win, R CMD build -->
<!-- ls is used in src/library/*/Makefile.win -->
<!-- mkdir is used in numerous Makefiles -->
<!-- rsync is only needed if building from svn -->
<!-- sed is used in tools/GETVERSION, many Makefiles -->
<!-- touch is used in Makefiles -->
<!-- unzip is used in making R, e.g. for zoneinfo.zip -->
<!-- wc is used in doc/manual/Makefile.win -->
<!-- AFAICS [g]awk, egrep, head, rmdir, tail, tr are no longer used -->
   <p>If you choose to install these yourself, you will need suitable versions
of at least <code>basename</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>cmp</code>, <code>comm</code>,
<code>cp</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>diff</code>, <code>echo</code>,
<code>expr</code> <code>grep</code>, <code>gzip</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>make</code>,
<code>makeinfo</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mv</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>rsync</code>,
<code>sed</code>, <code>sh</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>tar</code>, <code>texindex</code>,
<code>touch</code> and <code>uniq</code>; we use those from the Cygwin distribution
(<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>) or compiled from the sources.  You will
also need <code>zip</code> and <code>unzip</code> from the Info-ZIP project
(<a href="http://www.info-zip.org/">http://www.info-zip.org/</a>).  All of these tools are in
<samp><span class="file">Rtools*.exe</span></samp>.

<!-- So needed for end users: -->
<!-- basename comm cp diff echo gzip make mkdir rm sh sort tar uniq zip -->
   <p><strong>Beware</strong>: `Native' ports of make are <strong>not</strong> suitable
(including that called `MinGW make' at the MinGW SourceForge site). 
There were also problems with other versions of the Cygwin tools and
DLLs.  To avoid frustration, please use our tool set, and make sure it
is at the front of your path (including before the Windows system
directories).  If you are using a Windows shell, type <code>PATH</code> at the
prompt to find out.

   <p><a name="index-CYGWIN-120"></a>You may need to set the environment variable <samp><span class="env">CYGWIN</span></samp> to a value
including &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nodosfilewarning</span></samp>&rsquo; to suppress messages about
Windows-style paths.

<p><a name="The-MinGW-toolchain"></a>

<h3 class="section">D.4 The MinGW toolchain</h3>

<p>This is the only step which differs between 32- and 64-bit builds. 
Technically you need more than just a compiler so the set of tools is
referred to as a `toolchain'.

   <p>In each case you need to put the <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp> directory of the toolchain
early in your <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp>: if you use the recommended toolchains you can
have both in the path (in either order), and need to if you want to
install 32/64-bit packages.

<p><a name="32-bit-toolchain"></a>
<a name="g_t32_002dbit-toolchain"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">D.4.1 32-bit toolchain</h4>

<p>Note that the recommended toolchain for R 2.12.0 differs from that for
earlier versions, and there are binary incompatibilities, especially
where C++ code is involved.  So we recommend that all packages are built
with the current toolchain.

   <p>The 32-bit build for this version of R is set up to use <samp><span class="command">gcc</span></samp>
<code>4.5.0</code>.  The toolchain included in <samp><span class="file">Rtools212.exe</span></samp>, and was
collected from the files at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/</a>, specifically

<pre class="example">     binutils-2.20.51-1-mingw32-bin.tar.lzma
     gcc-c++-4.5.0-1-mingw32-bin.tar.lzma
     gcc-core-4.5.0-1-mingw32-bin.tar.lzma
     gcc-fortran-4.5.0-1-mingw32-bin.tar.lzma
     libgcc-4.5.0-1-mingw32-dll-1.tar.lzma
     libgmp-5.0.1-1-mingw32-dll-10.tar.lzma
     libgomp-4.5.0-1-mingw32-dll-1.tar.lzma
     libmpc-0.8.1-1-mingw32-dll-2.tar.lzma
     libmpfr-2.4.1-1-mingw32-dll-1.tar.lzma
     libssp-4.5.0-1-mingw32-dll-0.tar.lzma
     mingwrt-3.18-mingw32-dev.tar.gz
     mingwrt-3.18-mingw32-dll.tar.gz
     w32api-3.15-1-mingw32-dev.tar.lzma
</pre>
   <p>with the import libraries in <samp><span class="file">lib/gcc/mingw32/4.5.0</span></samp> moved to a
subdirectory <samp><span class="file">dlls</span></samp> so that <samp><span class="file">libgfortran</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">libstdc++</span></samp>
are linked statically.

   <p>It is also possible to use the 32-bit toolchain from the
<code>mingw-w64</code> project (which is currently using pre-releases of
<samp><span class="command">gcc 4.5.2</span></samp>) and options to use that are documented in file
<samp><span class="file">MkRules.dist</span></samp>.

<p><a name="64-bit-toolchain"></a>
<a name="g_t64_002dbit-toolchain"></a>

<h4 class="subsection">D.4.2 64-bit toolchain</h4>

<p>Several versions of the MinGW-w64 toolchain are available: use one of
them to replace (or supplement) the 32-bit toolchain's <samp><span class="file">bin</span></samp>
directory in your path.  Then copy file <samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist</span></samp>
to <samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/MkRules.local</span></samp> and edit it to set <code>WIN=64</code>
and <code>BINPREF64</code> and <code>SYMPAT64</code> appropriate to your toolchain,
then make R in the usual way.

   <p>The toolchain we use is technically a cross-compiler: the tools run
under 32-bit Windows but produce code to run under 64-bit
Windows.<a rel="footnote" href="#fn-38" name="fnd-38"><sup>38</sup></a>  This is based on files from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Automated%20Builds/</a>
and has a name like <samp><span class="file">mingw-w64-1.0-bin_i686-mingw_20100917.zip</span></samp>,
including a pre-release of <samp><span class="command">gcc 4.5.2</span></samp>.  However, this has been
patched to use static Fortran and C++ runtime libraries: a suitable
toolchain is included in <samp><span class="file">Rtools212.exe</span></samp>.

   <p><strong>NB:</strong> 64-bit toolchains after late April 2010 at that site
generate objects with symbols without a leading underscore.  Other
toolchains (including that used for R 2.11.x) may use leading
underscores, in which case <code>SYMPAT64</code> in
<samp><span class="file">src/gnuwin32/MkRules.dist</span></samp> needs to be set (see the comments in
that file).  If you are using a binary distribution of R, check that
the settings of <code>BINPREF</code> and <code>SYMPAT</code> in file
<samp><span class="file">etc/x64/Makeconf</span></samp> are appropriate to your toolchain (following the
comments in the file).  The use or not of leading underscores affects
linking to external static and import libraries but not linking directly
to DLLs.

   <p>Other toolchains are available: for example under
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/</a>
contains a native x64 Windows toolchain by `sezero' that may be useful
when building external software.

<p><a name="Useful-additional-programs"></a>

<h3 class="section">D.5 Useful additional programs</h3>

<p>The process of making the installer will make use of <code>qpdf</code> to
compact some of the package vignettes, if available.  MinGW binaries of
<code>qpdf</code> are available from
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpdf/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/qpdf/files/</a>.  Set the path
to the <code>qpdf</code> installation in file <samp><span class="file">MkRules.local</span></samp>.

   <p>Developers of packages will find some of the `goodies' at
<a href="http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies">http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies</a> useful.

   <p>There is a version of the <samp><span class="command">file</span></samp> command that identifies the
type of files, and is used by <samp><span class="command">Rcmd check</span></samp> if available.

   <p>The file <samp><span class="file">xzutils.zip</span></samp> contains the program <samp><span class="command">xz</span></samp> which can
be used to (de)compress files with that form of compression.

example, the Cygwin version of <code>make 3.81</code> fails to work

   <p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-38" href="#fnd-38">38</a>]</small> As the R build process itself runs R, it has to
