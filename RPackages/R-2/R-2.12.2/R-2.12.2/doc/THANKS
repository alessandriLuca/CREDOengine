The R Foundation may decide to give out <first.lastname>@R-project.org
email addresses to contributors to the R Project (even without making them
members of the R Foundation) when in the view of the R Foundation this
would help advance the R project.

The R Core Group, Roger Bivand, John Fox and Bill Venables are the
ordinary members of the R Foundation.  In addition, Dirk Eddelbuettel,
Torsten Hothorn, Uwe Ligges, David Meyer, Deepayan Sarkar, Simon Wood,
and Achim Zeileis are also e-addressable by
<Firstname>.<Lastname>@R-project.org.

Many more, too numerous to mention here, have contributed by sending bug
reports and suggesting various improvements.

Simon Davies whilst at the University of Auckland wrote the original
version of glm().

Julian Harris and Wing Kwong (Tiki) Wan whilst at the University of
Auckland assisted Ross Ihaka with the original Macintosh port.

R was inspired by the S environment which has been principally
developed by John Chambers, with substantial input from Douglas Bates,
Rick Becker, Bill Cleveland, Trevor Hastie, Daryl Pregibon and 
Allan Wilks.

A special debt is owed to John Chambers who has graciously contributed
advice and encouragement in the early days of R and later became a
member of the core team.
