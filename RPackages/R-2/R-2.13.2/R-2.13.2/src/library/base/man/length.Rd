\title{Length of an Object}
\description{
  Get or set the length of vectors (including lists) and factors, and of
  any other \R object for which a method has been defined.
}
\usage{
length(x)
length(x) <- value
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{an \R object.  For replacement, a vector or factor.}
  \item{value}{an integer: double values will be coerced to integer.}
}
\value{
  The default method currently returns an \code{\link{integer}} of
  length 1.  Since this may change in the future and may
  differ for other methods, programmers should not rely on it.
  (Should the length exceed the maximum representable integer, it is
  returned as \code{NA}.)

  For vectors (including lists) and factors the length is the number of
  elements.  For an environment it is the number of objects in the
  environment, and \code{NULL} has length 0.  For expressions and
  pairlists (including language objects and dotlists) it is the length
  of the pairlist chain.  All other objects (including functions) have
  length one: note that for functions this differs from S.

  The replacement form removes all the attributes of \code{x} except its
  names.  
}
\details{
  Both functions are generic: you can write methods to handle specific
  classes of objects, see \link{InternalMethods}.  \code{length<-} has a
  \code{"factor"} method.

  The replacement form can be used to reset the length of a vector.  If
  a vector is shortened, extra values are discarded and when a vector is
  lengthened, it is padded out to its new length with \code{\link{NA}}s
  (\code{nul} for raw vectors).
  
  Both are \link{primitive} functions.
}

  character vectors.

\examples{
length(diag(4))# = 16 (4 x 4)
length(options())# 12 or more
length(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3)# 3
length(expression(x, {y <- x^2; y+2}, x^y)) # 3

## from example(warpbreaks)
require(stats)

fm1 <- lm(breaks ~ wool * tension, data = warpbreaks)
length(fm1$call) # 3, lm() and two arguments.
length(formula(fm1)) # 3, ~ lhs rhs
