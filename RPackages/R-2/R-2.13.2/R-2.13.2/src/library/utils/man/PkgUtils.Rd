\title{Utilities for Building and Checking Add-on Packages}
\description{
  Utilities for checking whether the sources of an \R add-on package
  work correctly, and for building a source package from them.
}
\usage{
\special{R CMD check [options] pkgdirs}
\special{R CMD build [options] pkgdirs}
}
\arguments{
  \item{pkgdirs}{a list of names of directories with sources of \R
    add-on packages.  For \code{check} these can also be the filenames of
    compressed \command{tar} archives with extension \file{.tar.gz},
    \file{.tgz}, \file{.tar.bz2} or \file{.tar.xz} (where supported by
    \command{tar}).}
  \item{options}{further options to control the processing, or for
    obtaining information about usage and version of the utility.}
}
\details{
  \command{R CMD check}
  checks \R add-on packages from their sources, performing a wide
  variety of diagnostic checks.

  \command{R CMD build} builds \R source tarballs.  The name(s) of the
  packages are taken from the \file{DESCRIPTION} files and not from the
  directory names.  As from \R 2.13.0 this works entirely on a copy of
  the supplied source directories.

  Use \command{R CMD \var{foo} --help} to obtain usage information on
  utility \code{\var{foo}}.

  The defaults for some of the options to \command{R CMD build} can be
  set by environment variables \env{_R_BUILD_RESAVE_DATA_} and
  \env{_R_BUILD_COMPACT_VIGNETTES_}: see \sQuote{Writing \R Extensions}.
  Many of the checks in \command{R CMD check} can be turned off or on by
  environment variables: see Chapter 6 of the \sQuote{R Internals} manual.

  They make use of a temporary directory specified by the environment
  variable \code{TMPDIR} and defaulting to \samp{c:/TEMP}.  Do ensure
